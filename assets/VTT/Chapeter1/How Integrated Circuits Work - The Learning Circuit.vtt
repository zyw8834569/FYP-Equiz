00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.880
hi and welcome back to the learning

7
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.770
circuit today we're going to learn about

8
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.910
integrated circuits or ICS so far in

9
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.590
this series I focused on discrete

10
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.449
components electronic devices

11
00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.760
constructed as a single unit such as

12
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.340
transistors resistors capacitors and

13
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.950
diodes but I've wanted to make things a

14
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.930
little more interesting dive a little

15
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.120
deeper and to do that we need to get

16
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.309
into integrated circuits while the

17
00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.110
screen components have a single simple

18
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.510
function ICS take those components and

19
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.090
integrate them into circuits on a single

20
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.239
chip hence integrated circuit if you've

21
00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.010
ever opened up a piece of electronics

22
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.899
and checked out the PCB you've probably

23
00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.550
seen these little black squares or

24
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.219
rectangles those are integrated circuits

25
00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.730
ICS let's start with looking at one very

26
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.840
common I see a 741 op amp here's the

27
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.549
schematic diagram found in the chips

28
00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.560
datasheet hopefully by now you'll

29
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.630
recognize all these symbols being 22

30
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.000
transistors 12 resistors and one

31
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.670
capacitor now rather than the circuit

32
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.170
being made of discrete components

33
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.170
soldered onto a PCB the entire circuit

34
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.640
is printed onto a single piece of

35
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.310
silicon all those transistors resistors

36
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.770
and capacitors are in there made of tiny

37
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.470
n-type and p-type structures connected

38
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.710
on the surface by aluminum plating now

39
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.720
ICS are already pretty small but the

40
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.369
actual functional part of the chip

41
00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.790
inside is even smaller the silicon chips

42
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.250
inside the casing are so small that they

43
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.899
have tiny wires running through the

44
00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.149
casing that connected this tiny chip to

45
00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.430
the external pins and terminals let's

46
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.810
take a look at what those external

47
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.299
casings look like some simple ICS that

48
00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.219
don't require many pins make use of

49
00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.930
packages designed for discrete

50
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.790
components like those of transistors

51
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.979
like these voltage regulators that

52
00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.049
utilize the same packaging as MOSFETs

53
00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.079
others like these single inline packages

54
00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.899
have more pins but along only one side

55
00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.150
through-hole chips with contacts don't

56
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.590
to opposite sides

57
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.010
our dual inline packages or dips dips

58
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.379
often use sockets so they may easily be

59
00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.930
replaced if damaged small outline

60
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.000
packages include varieties of surface

61
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.750
mount chips such as SOI CS T stops and s

62
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.560
o J's for more complex ICS that require

63
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.769
more input/output or IO chip carriers

64
00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.739
have J shaped pins or metal pads on all

65
00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.379
four sides of the package and still some

66
00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.150
integrated circuits require so many

67
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.250
connections that they use grid arrays

68
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.040
pins for through-hole and falls for

69
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.319
surface mount now to figure out the pin

70
00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.209
numbering in all these chips you can

71
00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.910
often find a notch or dot on one of the

72
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.599
edges or corners pin one will be at or

73
00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.910
to the left of the dot or notch and

74
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.579
continuing down the left side around the

75
00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.489
chip and in counter clockwise fashion

76
00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.379
the pin out on four sided chips may be

77
00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.510
less straightforward the dot on these

78
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.940
can be in one of the corners or in the

79
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.610
middle of one side so that the one side

80
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.349
is split having pins at both the

81
00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.120
beginning and end of the numbering

82
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.340
scheme integrated circuits can be broken

83
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.670
down into three basic categories digital

84
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.630
analog or a combination of the two

85
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.269
[Music]

86
00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.799
analog or linear ICS respond to produce

87
00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.720
and/or amplify signals of varying

88
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.790
degrees of voltage two of the most

89
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.849
common types of analog ICS are op amps

90
00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.349
and voltage regulators

91
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.460
operational amplifiers or op amps offer

92
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.770
a high gain over a wide range of

93
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.840
frequencies while the chips have eight

94
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.150
pins the schematic symbol only shows

95
00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.820
five leads the remaining three pins that

96
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.170
are not typically represented by the

97
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.750
symbol are specialized and used for fine

98
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.940
tuning keep an eye out for that symbol

99
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.250
as op amps are often incorporated into

100
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.910
other ICS voltage regulators regulate

101
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.339
voltage by automatically adjusting the

102
00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.230
amount of current flowing through a load

103
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.329
in order to maintain a constant output

104
00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.180
voltage they typically have an input

105
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.790
voltage range and can have either a

106
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.430
single fixed output voltage or an

107
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.470
adjustable output voltage range

108
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.719
[Music]

109
00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:36.299
analog circuits are quite useful but if

110
00:04:36.299 --> 00:04:38.099
we want to be able to process or store

111
00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:41.219
data we need digital electronics digital

112
00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:43.469
circuits operate using only two states

113
00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:47.489
high and low often represented by 1 & 0

114
00:04:47.489 --> 00:04:51.299
respectively digital ICS include logic

115
00:04:51.299 --> 00:04:53.849
gates flip-flops shift registers

116
00:04:53.849 --> 00:05:00.779
counters memories and processors much of

117
00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:02.969
electronics revolves around logic if

118
00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.009
this is happening then this should

119
00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:07.259
happen this is where logic gates come in

120
00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:09.479
a logic gate uses the conditions of its

121
00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:11.729
input or inputs to determine the state

122
00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.159
of its output they include not gates

123
00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:18.979
also called inverters and NAND or nor

124
00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.769
xor and X nor in the same category there

125
00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:25.169
are also flip-flops and latches with

126
00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:26.999
each logic gate only requiring a few

127
00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:28.860
pins rather than being packaged

128
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.659
individually they are often bundled

129
00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:32.969
together with multiple gates in a single

130
00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:35.189
chip when looking at logic circuits

131
00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:36.869
you'll likely come across a few

132
00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:38.729
abbreviations that would be helpful to

133
00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:43.639
know TTL transistor transistor logic ECL

134
00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:48.649
emitter coupled logic CMOS complementary

135
00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:50.909
metal-oxide-semiconductor x' using

136
00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:53.039
MOSFETs while these can be made with

137
00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:54.839
discrete components they can often be

138
00:05:54.839 --> 00:06:00.809
found as an IC next in digital ICS are

139
00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:03.269
memory chips the two main types being

140
00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:06.689
random access memory RAM and read-only

141
00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:07.379
memory

142
00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:10.649
ROM Ram is the type of memory like in

143
00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:12.329
your computer that can be read and

144
00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:15.659
written over and over again ROM cannot

145
00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:17.519
be written over and is typically

146
00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:19.769
programmed at the factory though you may

147
00:06:19.769 --> 00:06:22.259
hear of EEPROM erasable programmable

148
00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:24.509
read-only memory that can be

149
00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:26.879
reprogrammed by an individual these

150
00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:28.800
chips have a transparent window that

151
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.269
allows for the UV light exposure

152
00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:32.610
required to be able to rewrite the chip

153
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.649
however they have mostly been replaced

154
00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:37.289
by EEE proms which can be programmed and

155
00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:39.960
erased in circuit

156
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.120
[Music]

157
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.200
some integrated circuits are

158
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.660
mixed-signal incorporating both analog

159
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.150
and digital signals let's start by

160
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.210
talking about converters an analog to

161
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.060
digital converter or ADC receives an

162
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.090
analog input signal and outputs a 4-bit

163
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.250
binary number that is proportional to

164
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.220
the analog voltage it measured a digital

165
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.830
to analog converter or DAC takes a

166
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.660
binary number and converts it to an

167
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.090
analog voltage that is proportional to

168
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:16.270
the binary number but the most exciting

169
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.380
mixed-signal ICS RMC use not the Marvel

170
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.200
Cinematic Universe but microcontrollers

171
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.270
a microcontroller is essentially a

172
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.780
computer on a chip it has a simple

173
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.340
microprocessor flash memory for holding

174
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.770
its single program RAM for holding

175
00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:35.050
temporary data and lots of general

176
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.770
purpose input/output known as GPIO MCS

177
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.750
are considered mixed signal because many

178
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.050
include an ADC or a DAC on chip they are

179
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.120
commonly found as the brains of larger

180
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.310
boards which are also confusingly

181
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.250
referred to as microcontrollers such as

182
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.630
Arduino zorb eaglebones

183
00:07:56.189 --> 00:07:58.750
the last I see I want to talk about is

184
00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.759
one that's incredibly useful it's

185
00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:04.000
inexpensive and quite robust but it

186
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.889
falls in a bit of a fuzzy area when

187
00:08:05.889 --> 00:08:08.289
being defined as analog or digital the

188
00:08:08.289 --> 00:08:10.960
555 timer this little 8 pin chip

189
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.569
contains two comparators a flip-flop and

190
00:08:13.569 --> 00:08:16.389
inverter two transistors and a voltage

191
00:08:16.389 --> 00:08:18.250
divider it can be used as an oscillator

192
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.310
for use in LED flashers logic clocks

193
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.639
tone generators pulse generators simple

194
00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:26.919
ADCs and more it can function as a

195
00:08:26.919 --> 00:08:29.139
one-shot pulse generator for use in

196
00:08:29.139 --> 00:08:31.569
timers touch switches capacitance

197
00:08:31.569 --> 00:08:34.419
measurement and PWM it can also function

198
00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:36.240
as what is called a Schmitt trigger

199
00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.578
functioning as a flip-flop 5 v 5s can

200
00:08:39.578 --> 00:08:43.360
also be found in pairs in the 14 pin 556

201
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.350
IC chips or for to a chip in the 16 pin

202
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.709
5 v 8 in future episodes I'll be diving

203
00:08:50.709 --> 00:08:52.600
a little deeper into some of the ICS I

204
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.700
mentioned today including voltage

205
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.980
regulators op amps and five-five-five

206
00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.620
timers but what other ICS do you want to

207
00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.720
learn about or is there a project you've

208
00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.459
been dying to see that includes one of

209
00:09:03.459 --> 00:09:05.860
the ICS I mentioned today tell me about

210
00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.560
your ideas on the element14 community on

211
00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.440
element14.com /the learning circuit

212
00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.310
happy learning
