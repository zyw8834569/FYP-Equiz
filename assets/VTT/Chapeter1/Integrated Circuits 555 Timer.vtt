00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.740
what is going on everyone my name is

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:02.760
Kota moore and welcome back to

3
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.130
electronics episode 24 in this episode

4
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.109
we will be covering integrated circuits

5
00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.360
and specifically the 555 timer

6
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.639
integrated circuit today and I'm very

7
00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.500
very very excited to be making this

8
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.360
episode because today we are finished

9
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.070
with all the boring stuff that we just

10
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.109
learned in the previous tutorials we are

11
00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.850
taking our very first steps into the

12
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.869
things that we're going to need to

13
00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.420
really really know in making an 8-bit

14
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.949
computer this is going to be really

15
00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.830
exciting so let's get to it now in IC is

16
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.619
short for an integrated circuit and it

17
00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.239
is a circuit that is packaged on or

18
00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.219
essentially placed within a very very

19
00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.469
small piece of semiconductive material

20
00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.690
or more basically it is a circuit that

21
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.370
is made to be very very small

22
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.620
now most I sees that you're going to see

23
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.960
look either like this or this here now

24
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.000
this first I see that you can see here

25
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.430
is an integrated circuit that has zip

26
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.480
packaging or dual inline package ngey IP

27
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.149
basically it has pins as you can see

28
00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.039
here that can be easily accessed and

29
00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.050
placed into a breadboard for example and

30
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.359
the other common type of IC packaging is

31
00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.700
called surface mount packaging and that

32
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.470
is what you can see right here now these

33
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.200
are both the exact same IC just there in

34
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.000
different packaging and surface mount

35
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.100
packages like this chip right here are

36
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.840
usually used more at the production

37
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.119
level for mass-produced circuits rather

38
00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.070
than prototyping because the pins are so

39
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.740
much smaller now because of this any IC

40
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.360
that you purchase for the most part will

41
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.670
likely want to be a dual inline package

42
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.979
IC or it should look something like this

43
00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.869
with the longer pins that you're able to

44
00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.790
easily access input into a breadboard

45
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.189
now ICS have many different functions of

46
00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.840
course they all do something completely

47
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.460
different it will be discussing many of

48
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.869
them as we go on with this tutorial

49
00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:40.200
series

50
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.450
but one of the most popular ICS that you

51
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.130
should first learn about in electronics

52
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.630
is probably going to be the 5 5 5 timer

53
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.930
IC or the triple 5 timer and this IC has

54
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.000
been used for many many years and it has

55
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.710
many different uses but today we will be

56
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.149
using it to create an oscillating

57
00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.590
circuit like we did in the previous

58
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.570
video however it'll be much more

59
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.280
controllable accurate and stable

60
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.930
compared to the circuit that we built

61
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.390
last time now the triple 5 timer IC

62
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.280
which I have right here as well as the

63
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.378
previous two ICS that you just saw has

64
00:02:10.378 --> 00:02:13.110
eight pins in this example you can see

65
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.890
four of them on

66
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.900
front here and there are also for them

67
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.330
on the other side of this now whenever

68
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.550
you are working with an IC the pins are

69
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.020
numbered and they are numbered

70
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.120
counterclockwise starting at the upper

71
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.790
left pin and you can tell what pin is

72
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.160
the upper left because every IC will

73
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.320
usually have a small little indentation

74
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.670
like this one does right here at the

75
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.860
upper left so we know that this is pin

76
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.720
number one or if that's not the case

77
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.820
it'll have a little indentation on the

78
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.620
top part right here which you can kind

79
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.510
of see right there and that indicates

80
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.640
the top of the chip so that we know this

81
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.320
pin should be number one as well and

82
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.209
this IC just happens to have both of

83
00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.250
those they both example and the little

84
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.530
dot here but some ICS may only have one

85
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.090
of those they all look a little bit

86
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.459
different and like I said the pins on an

87
00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.280
IC are numbered counterclockwise so in

88
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.769
the case of a five five five timer pin

89
00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.660
one is connected to ground or

90
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.070
essentially the negative terminal of

91
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.070
your battery and pin eight is called VCC

92
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.660
here or essentially where you're going

93
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.250
to connect the positive terminal of your

94
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.709
battery to now in the case of most other

95
00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.220
ICS the bottom-left pin will usually be

96
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.930
your ground pin while the upper right

97
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.360
pin will usually be your VCC or your

98
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.370
positive terminal pin but of course all

99
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.680
ICS are different so it's very important

100
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.450
to have the data sheet for the IC that

101
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.010
you are working with in front you to

102
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.360
know what all the pins mean and what

103
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.829
they should be connected to for example

104
00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.900
if you accidentally connect VCC and

105
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.150
ground backwards you could badly damage

106
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.970
the IC chip so I know the names of each

107
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.829
one of these pins just because I looked

108
00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.410
at the data sheet for the 555 timer now

109
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.180
I'm going to begin by drawing out the

110
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.769
circuit building it and I'm seeing it

111
00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.630
work and then I will go through a very

112
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.700
detailed explanation of how everything

113
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.799
works in the triple v timer now we are

114
00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.720
going to use the triple v timer today

115
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.079
and what is called a stable mode and the

116
00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.750
triple v timer can go in three modes you

117
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.560
have a stable monostable and then i'm

118
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.790
going to write the other one down here

119
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.690
there's also by stable mode as well so

120
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.190
we are going to be making a circuit that

121
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.799
runs the triple v timer in a stable mode

122
00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.660
meaning that the output pin will be a

123
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.089
constant cycle so essentially from the

124
00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:19.769
output pin here that is where our

125
00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.450
oscillation is going to be it's going to

126
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.400
be off for a few seconds it'll turn on

127
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.860
for a few seconds off again on again off

128
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.910
again on again

129
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.830
in the square wave pattern and of course

130
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.390
it's going to do that automatically just

131
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.830
like the circuit we built in the last

132
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.020
video now it can also be run in what is

133
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.090
called mono stable mode where some sort

134
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.680
of trigger like a button press will

135
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.510
cause the output to go on and then off

136
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.220
for a set amount of time and there is

137
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.050
also by stable mode but we won't be

138
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.120
talking about monostable or by a stable

139
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.950
mode at this moment we are just going to

140
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.080
make a circuit that closely resembles

141
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.520
the circuit that we had in the last

142
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.260
video but of course is going to be much

143
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.300
better and more accurate and stable so

144
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.430
let me begin by drawing the schematic

145
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.990
diagram here first we're going to start

146
00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.880
out with our battery this is of course

147
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.710
the positive terminal of the battery and

148
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.740
that will be hooked up to VCC and from

149
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.510
the positive terminal of the battery we

150
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.150
will have a resistor here and I'll give

151
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.070
you the values of these resistors in

152
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.870
just a few moments and that resistor

153
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.790
will be connected to pin number seven or

154
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.130
the discharge pin of the IC and from

155
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.410
there after that resistor we will have

156
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.320
another resistor hooked up here and this

157
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.270
resistor will be connected to that's the

158
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.250
rush hold pin pin number six of the five

159
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.080
five five timer and I should actually

160
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.930
probably label this IC that way we know

161
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:31.500
what it is

162
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.470
the five five five timer and from here

163
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.520
we will actually have this go to the

164
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.610
trigger pin pin number two of the IC and

165
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.330
we will also have it go to a capacitor

166
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.700
right here and that capacitor the other

167
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.230
side will just be connected to ground

168
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.300
I'm just going to write GND that way I

169
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.680
don't have to make a connection all the

170
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.120
way up to the negative terminal of the

171
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.070
battery great now the control voltage

172
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.980
pin number five is just going to have a

173
00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.560
capacitor on it and that capacitor will

174
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.110
be connected to ground as well the reset

175
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.730
pin pin number four is going to be

176
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.350
connected directly to the positive

177
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.960
terminal of the battery or VCC again

178
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.550
instead of making a wire connection up

179
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.980
there I'm just going to write VCC so

180
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.840
that we know where it goes ground will

181
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.100
of course be connected to the negative

182
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.050
terminal of the battery here and then we

183
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.850
will have our output pin which actually

184
00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.250
has our oscillating signal and we'll

185
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.650
connect that to a different circuit like

186
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.180
a blinking light or something so

187
00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.580
actually let's have this output pin jump

188
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.590
over this wire and we can just lead this

189
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.440
on up to I don't know say a resistor

190
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.840
here and that resistor will just lead to

191
00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.150
an LED so that we can get a blinking

192
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.129
light and the LED will be

193
00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:43.080
connected to the negative terminal of

194
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.759
the battery so I know this is a really

195
00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:46.679
messy schematic symbol but this is what

196
00:06:46.679 --> 00:06:48.809
we want to build on our breadboard now

197
00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:50.939
this capacitor right here connected to

198
00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:53.610
control voltage I make that a zero point

199
00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.759
one nano farad capacitor really this can

200
00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:59.189
be any value capacitor but you probably

201
00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:01.469
just want a very small value so don't

202
00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:03.179
worry too much about the actual value of

203
00:07:03.179 --> 00:07:05.309
this one now for this other capacitor

204
00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:06.659
here as you can see I drew an

205
00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:08.519
electrolytic symbol here because I want

206
00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:10.379
a slightly larger value you can use a

207
00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:12.509
value such as a 100 micro farad

208
00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:14.429
capacitor in my case I'm going to be

209
00:07:14.429 --> 00:07:18.769
using a 470 micro farad capacitor and

210
00:07:18.769 --> 00:07:21.330
essentially the larger the capacitance

211
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.039
value right here the lower your

212
00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:24.599
frequency is going to be or essentially

213
00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:26.789
your light is going to blink slower with

214
00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:28.559
the larger the capacitance that you have

215
00:07:28.559 --> 00:07:30.300
so you can experiment around and try

216
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.039
different values for this capacitor here

217
00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:33.659
if you would like and then the two

218
00:07:33.659 --> 00:07:35.779
resistors will actually will make them

219
00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:39.659
4.7 K ohm resistors so this one will

220
00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:42.749
also be a 4.7 K ohm resistor as well

221
00:07:42.749 --> 00:07:45.149
again you don't have to use exact values

222
00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:46.559
it can be a bit different of course and

223
00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:48.240
I should probably mention that I will be

224
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.309
using a nine volt power source which

225
00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:52.649
means that your resistor over here will

226
00:07:52.649 --> 00:07:54.599
have to be of a large enough value that

227
00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:56.309
where your LED won't burn out so in my

228
00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:57.779
case I'm just going to approximate I'm

229
00:07:57.779 --> 00:08:00.749
just going to use a 1 kilo ohm resistor

230
00:08:00.749 --> 00:08:02.399
here because I'm just assuming that

231
00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:04.050
that's not going to make my LED burn out

232
00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.550
or anything it should resist enough

233
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:07.499
electricity for that all to work so

234
00:08:07.499 --> 00:08:08.789
there we go that is what we will be

235
00:08:08.789 --> 00:08:10.499
using to make our circuit let's build it

236
00:08:10.499 --> 00:08:12.360
run it and then we will go into full-on

237
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.550
in-depth explanation about it so I'm not

238
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:15.990
going to go through and build the entire

239
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:17.610
circuit on camera you should be able to

240
00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.199
see most of the connections here all I

241
00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:21.240
have to do is add two more resistors in

242
00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.919
this circuit will be completed along

243
00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:25.019
with our schematic that we made as you

244
00:08:25.019 --> 00:08:27.329
can see I have my 470 micro farad

245
00:08:27.329 --> 00:08:29.339
capacitor my point 1 nano farad

246
00:08:29.339 --> 00:08:31.110
capacitor like I said this one isn't

247
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.179
required but you probably want to have

248
00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.370
it it's good practice to do so I have my

249
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.589
triple 5 timer chip and if i zoom into

250
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:39.688
it a bit more here you should be able to

251
00:08:39.688 --> 00:08:41.669
slightly see on the top here there's a

252
00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:43.589
little indent and I'm sorry that it's

253
00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:45.240
hard to see on the camera but that is

254
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.889
how I know it's the top of the chip and

255
00:08:46.889 --> 00:08:49.559
that this pin is the upper-left pin or

256
00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:51.420
pin number one so it's important that

257
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.889
you make sure that your triple 5 timer

258
00:08:52.889 --> 00:08:54.690
chip is oriented the proper

259
00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:55.950
direction and the same goes for

260
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.630
everything like the LED make sure that

261
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.490
sucked up correctly I have my resistor

262
00:08:59.490 --> 00:08:59.850
here

263
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.530
everything should be hooked up properly

264
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.000
let me just go ahead and I'm going to

265
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.610
take my two four point seven kilo ohm

266
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.560
resistors one is going to go from pin

267
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.720
eight to pin seven and you want to make

268
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.920
sure that you don't have any weird

269
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.360
connections touching each other

270
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.160
accidentally and the next is going to go

271
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.890
from pin seven to pin number six so let

272
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.080
me put that in right now as well so my

273
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.550
circuit looks very very message

274
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.440
especially up here that's probably why

275
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.880
you're going to want to spread out all

276
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.620
your connections a bit more so who has

277
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.000
time for that I certainly don't

278
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.950
so let's actually hook up the power and

279
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:30.990
get this thing running so once I connect

280
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.810
to the 9-volt battery the LED instantly

281
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.790
turns on and then after a couple of

282
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.130
seconds it should turn off breath and

283
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:39.840
it'll turn back on as you can see and

284
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.300
it's going to continue to blink and

285
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.740
later on in this video I show you how to

286
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.870
calculate the frequency of how this

287
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.640
light is turning on and off but anyways

288
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.680
this is the circuit in action so let's

289
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.330
go into an explanation of all of this

290
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.340
now this is probably going to be the

291
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:54.960
biggest explanation that I have ever

292
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.240
done this far in this series there is a

293
00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.370
lot of stuff that I have to explain here

294
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:00.810
and there's also a lot of things within

295
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:02.520
the triple five timer that we haven't

296
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.110
talked about yet that I also have to

297
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:05.910
explain now it can be a really tricky

298
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:07.920
thing to understand so if you get really

299
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.810
really confused don't worry about it

300
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.670
follow along with the series maybe come

301
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:13.830
back to this video it can be quite tough

302
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.420
to understand and I'm going to try my

303
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.400
best to explain it the best I possibly

304
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.440
can now there's a thing within the

305
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.210
triple five timer called a flip-flop

306
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:23.790
I've drawn it so that it looks kind of

307
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.440
like a switch but it's really not a

308
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.420
physical switch in the triple five timer

309
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.430
but I just drew it that way because it's

310
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.860
easier to show how it functions so there

311
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.690
isn't an actual physical switch within

312
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.910
here second of all we see that there are

313
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.310
these two little triangle things in here

314
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:41.060
and those two triangle things are called

315
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.190
comparators right here we have not

316
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.620
talked about comparators yet so let's do

317
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.290
a brief little introduction into what

318
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:50.760
the comparators are going to be doing

319
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.339
within the triple five timer so we have

320
00:10:53.339 --> 00:10:55.890
two inputs the top is called the V plus

321
00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.290
input the bottom is called the V minus

322
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.420
input and then coming out of a tip of

323
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.240
the triangle we have the output signal

324
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.280
and actually before I continue on with

325
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.470
this explanation I have to explain two

326
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:08.570
words that I'm going to be used

327
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.370
throughout the remainder of this series

328
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:13.220
I'm going to be using the words hi and

329
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.980
I'm also going to be using the word lo

330
00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:19.280
quite a bit whenever I say hi it means

331
00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.980
that there is voltage we are connected

332
00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.930
to the positive rail it's sending out

333
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:25.850
voltage on this wire or this is

334
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.920
essentially equivalent to the number one

335
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.710
meaning we do have voltage whenever I

336
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:33.680
use the word lo I mean we don't have any

337
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.390
voltage or we're connected to ground

338
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.000
zero volts in fact and this is also

339
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.920
equivalent to the number zero you'll see

340
00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.470
that a lot so hi we are sending out

341
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:44.450
voltage on whatever wire we're talking

342
00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:46.850
about low means we are not sending out

343
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:48.440
voltage instead we are connected to

344
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.600
ground on that wire those are two very

345
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.040
important words that we're going to be

346
00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.660
using throughout the remainder of this

347
00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:56.900
series hi is voltage low is no voltage

348
00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.040
or ground

349
00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.920
okay back to comparators right here now

350
00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.200
I've written down exactly what happens

351
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.780
here in these two lines so what we are

352
00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.240
saying is that the output signal here

353
00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.430
the output will be high or it will

354
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:13.580
connect to VCC to positive voltage and

355
00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.070
it will send out positive voltage only

356
00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:19.550
if the V Plus input is greater than the

357
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:21.680
V minus input so if we have more voltage

358
00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.630
coming into the plus input than we do

359
00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.460
coming into the minus input then the

360
00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.650
output will become high and it will send

361
00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:30.320
out positive voltage for us however and

362
00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.060
I also have this written down next to it

363
00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:35.450
over here the output will be low or

364
00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:38.600
connected to ground if the V Plus input

365
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.210
is less than to the minus input so if

366
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:42.800
the voltage coming into the plus input

367
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.960
is less than the voltage coming into the

368
00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.700
minus input the output will be low

369
00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.160
connect to ground that is what a

370
00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.930
comparator does and I'm going to leave

371
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:53.690
this text on the screen right up here

372
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.310
that way that you can refer to it as I

373
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:57.710
am explaining things because it is a

374
00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:00.110
very key part of the triple v timer of

375
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.360
course now that those basic explanations

376
00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.220
are out of the way let's get to how this

377
00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.470
is working so the first thing that we

378
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:08.390
are going to notice is that the VCC and

379
00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:11.090
ground pins are connected by three

380
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.880
resistors in series here and these three

381
00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.520
resistors actually split up our input

382
00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.550
voltage so go to comparator a here is

383
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:22.540
going to be one third of our supply

384
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.120
by voltage one third of our VCC while

385
00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:28.240
this wire going down to comparator B to

386
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.490
the minus input is going to be two

387
00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:33.490
thirds of our input voltage two-thirds

388
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:36.430
of our VCC now I used a 9-volt battery

389
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:38.500
so instead of writing that I'm just

390
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.630
going to say that constantly we are

391
00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.190
getting to the plus input of this

392
00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.770
comparator three volts because that is

393
00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:46.990
one third of my nine volt supply into

394
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:49.180
the minus input of the B comparator we

395
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.890
are getting six volts because that is

396
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.290
two thirds of my power supply and that's

397
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:55.180
pretty much going to stay constant we

398
00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:56.920
will always be comparing something to

399
00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.870
three volts here in something to six

400
00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:00.910
volts down here now really the only

401
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:02.770
tough part that I have to explain is

402
00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:05.050
this control voltage pin here which as

403
00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:06.760
you can see is also connected to this

404
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.340
minus input basically don't worry about

405
00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.380
this control voltage pin for now because

406
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.700
all in all it's pretty much just

407
00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.890
connected to ground constantly and the

408
00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:16.750
only reason that we have this capacitor

409
00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.270
here is just to smooth out the input

410
00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:21.400
that way we have a nice smooth voltage

411
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.320
going into this comparator that's the

412
00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.150
only reason we have this capacitor here

413
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.430
and the control voltage pin also helps

414
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:29.350
set the sensitivity of the triple v

415
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:31.480
timer but again for this basic

416
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.310
explanation and because we just have

417
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:34.900
this connected to ground essentially

418
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.270
imagine that this control voltage pin is

419
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:38.800
doing nothing so we're just comparing

420
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.350
something to six volts here and trust me

421
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:43.030
that isn't going to hurt my explanation

422
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:45.070
when we first start up this triple v

423
00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:47.830
timer what happens well we have from the

424
00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.680
VCC pin traveling through this resistor

425
00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.080
here and electricity instead of

426
00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.780
traveling down here it has an easier

427
00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.300
path to travel it will actually choose

428
00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.850
to go through the discharge pin instead

429
00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:03.220
and go directly to ground because

430
00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.140
through the flip-flop here that switch

431
00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.390
is connected to ground to begin with so

432
00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:08.980
electricity is basically just going to

433
00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.590
go from the positive to ground and it's

434
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:13.150
just going to skip this entire part

435
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:14.890
right here because it's an easier path

436
00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:17.200
so if that is happening then we

437
00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.830
basically just have a ground signal

438
00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:23.080
traveling over on to the trigger input

439
00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.510
pin so we have going to this negative

440
00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:28.420
input of the a comparator zero volts

441
00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.370
because it's connected to ground so

442
00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.920
let's look at our comparator settings up

443
00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.350
here what will this comparator output

444
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:36.520
well the

445
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.280
plus input is greater than the v- input

446
00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.710
three volts is greater than zero volts

447
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:44.080
that means that the output of the

448
00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.180
comparator in letter a that means that

449
00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.280
the output of comparator a will be high

450
00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.130
or it will send out voltage and whenever

451
00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:53.590
we get a high output out of comparator a

452
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:56.230
the switches of the flip-flop are going

453
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.660
to switch to their down position so this

454
00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.790
switch right here is going to move down

455
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:03.100
here to a no connection while this

456
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.810
switch right here is going to move down

457
00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:07.870
to positive power instead of ground so

458
00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:10.180
we flip the switches downward in this

459
00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.430
flip-flop because the comparator letter

460
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:14.620
a is sending out a highest signal okay

461
00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:16.810
so when we start up the triple five

462
00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:19.240
timer essentially what happens is our

463
00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.940
output is almost instantly connected to

464
00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.030
positive power our output goes high so

465
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.700
our output is high so what happens after

466
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:31.000
all of this takes place well let's go

467
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.430
back to the start again we have coming

468
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:35.710
from positive power VCC through a

469
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:38.140
resistor except remember that the

470
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.450
flip-flop is in the down state right now

471
00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:43.060
so electricity isn't going to travel

472
00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.680
through the discharged pin any more

473
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.690
because it is no longer connected to

474
00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:48.850
ground it's connected to nothing so it

475
00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:51.250
has nowhere to travel to so instead

476
00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:53.260
it'll continue to travel through this

477
00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.390
resistor here and it will begin to

478
00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:58.810
charge up this capacitor right here so

479
00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.210
for a certain amount of time as this

480
00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:03.880
capacitor is charging up we will

481
00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.530
essentially have going through this

482
00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:07.660
threshold pin to the positive input of

483
00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.209
the D comparator zero volts and then

484
00:17:10.209 --> 00:17:11.980
after maybe a very short amount of time

485
00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:13.690
depending upon the capacitor and

486
00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:16.599
resistor values it will climb up to one

487
00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:19.119
volt and then after a little bit more

488
00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:21.250
time it'll climb up to maybe two volts

489
00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:24.280
and then three volts and because the V

490
00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.069
Plus input is less than the V minus

491
00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:29.260
input now because remember V minus is at

492
00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.300
six volts two-thirds of our supply

493
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.610
voltage our output of this comparator

494
00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:36.460
stays low so the switches aren't going

495
00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:38.080
to switch to up because the output is

496
00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.300
low it's not activating the flip-flop so

497
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.640
our output is essentially stuck at the

498
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.250
high output for so long and it's going

499
00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.340
to be stuck there until the input of our

500
00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.539
comparator the plus

501
00:17:49.539 --> 00:17:54.190
put reaches just over six volts so for

502
00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:55.779
example purposes I'm going to write

503
00:17:55.779 --> 00:17:57.519
seven volts but in reality it's just

504
00:17:57.519 --> 00:17:59.739
going to be a tiny tiny amount over six

505
00:17:59.739 --> 00:18:02.049
volts now the second that that happens

506
00:18:02.049 --> 00:18:04.450
comparator B is going to output a high

507
00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:07.210
signal because now v+ is greater than v

508
00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:09.850
- so since we have a high signal going

509
00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:12.100
to the switch-up portion of our

510
00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.350
flip-flop these switches that are in the

511
00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.899
down position are going to flip back to

512
00:18:16.899 --> 00:18:19.210
their up position again so let me go

513
00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:21.340
ahead and just remove all these lines

514
00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.409
here that I have drawn now these

515
00:18:23.409 --> 00:18:25.389
switches are back in their up position

516
00:18:25.389 --> 00:18:27.220
because we had a high signal come to the

517
00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:29.889
switch up input so because that all took

518
00:18:29.889 --> 00:18:32.320
time to happen because this capacitor

519
00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.629
was charging up to get to that voltage

520
00:18:34.629 --> 00:18:37.509
greater than 6 volt our output stayed

521
00:18:37.509 --> 00:18:40.659
high at VCC for some amount of time and

522
00:18:40.659 --> 00:18:42.879
it just switched back to its ground

523
00:18:42.879 --> 00:18:45.369
connection again so now our output has

524
00:18:45.369 --> 00:18:47.590
gone low so now what's going to happen

525
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:50.169
again let's begin at the beginning and

526
00:18:50.169 --> 00:18:53.080
see what is happening now from VCC we

527
00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.609
have power going through this resistor

528
00:18:54.609 --> 00:18:57.220
but now it has that easy path again it

529
00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.080
will go through the discharge pin to

530
00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.299
ground because that's an easier path for

531
00:19:01.299 --> 00:19:03.129
it to take to travel because our

532
00:19:03.129 --> 00:19:05.440
capacitor is about two-thirds of the way

533
00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.259
charged up it's at about 6 volts it's

534
00:19:08.259 --> 00:19:10.570
going to begin to discharge and it will

535
00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:14.710
start to discharge basically through the

536
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:16.539
trigger input right here through the

537
00:19:16.539 --> 00:19:19.509
minus sign of this a comparator right

538
00:19:19.509 --> 00:19:21.659
here so it's going to begin at 6 volts

539
00:19:21.659 --> 00:19:26.109
well in this case v+ is less than v - so

540
00:19:26.109 --> 00:19:28.149
our comparator is going to output a low

541
00:19:28.149 --> 00:19:29.859
signal so it's not going to make the

542
00:19:29.859 --> 00:19:32.049
switches go down just yet but slowly

543
00:19:32.049 --> 00:19:34.269
over time the capacitor is going to

544
00:19:34.269 --> 00:19:36.220
discharge it will go down to 5 volts

545
00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.979
it'll slowly go down to 4 volts and once

546
00:19:38.979 --> 00:19:41.950
it gets barely below 3 volts again for

547
00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:43.539
example purposes I'm just going to write

548
00:19:43.539 --> 00:19:45.700
2 volts to make it simple once it gets

549
00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.070
below 3 volts over that short amount of

550
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:50.529
time comparator a is going to output a

551
00:19:50.529 --> 00:19:52.749
high signal because now the plus is

552
00:19:52.749 --> 00:19:55.269
greater than V minus again so we're less

553
00:19:55.269 --> 00:19:57.159
than one-third of our supply voltage

554
00:19:57.159 --> 00:19:59.019
it's going to make the switches flip to

555
00:19:59.019 --> 00:20:01.119
their down position once more so our

556
00:20:01.119 --> 00:20:02.860
output was at ground

557
00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.049
or low for a little bit of time now it

558
00:20:05.049 --> 00:20:07.480
just switched back to high again in this

559
00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.850
cycle is going to repeat so at this

560
00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:13.059
point in our circuit the discharge pin

561
00:20:13.059 --> 00:20:15.190
is now in the down position connected to

562
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:17.679
nothing so it'll begin to recharge this

563
00:20:17.679 --> 00:20:19.840
capacitor right here and it will charge

564
00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.540
it until it's just over two thirds of

565
00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.820
our supply voltage again and when that

566
00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.740
happens this comparator will make the

567
00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.660
switches go to their up position again

568
00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.120
and the whole cycle is going to repeat

569
00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.160
and because this all takes a bit of time

570
00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.140
due to the resistors and the charging of

571
00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:36.400
the capacitor which I'm going to explain

572
00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.070
in just a few moments our output stays

573
00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:41.290
connected to ground or low for some

574
00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:42.760
amount of time and then it stays

575
00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.910
connected to VCC or it stays high for a

576
00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:46.960
little bit amount of time and it

577
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.669
switches back and forth between that

578
00:20:48.669 --> 00:20:51.190
it's an alternating cycle so hopefully

579
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.020
that explanation got you through how

580
00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.179
this triple v timer worked for us I'm

581
00:20:55.179 --> 00:20:56.770
really hoping that I explained it well

582
00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:58.510
enough if you have any questions at all

583
00:20:58.510 --> 00:20:59.980
leave them down below in the comments I

584
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.870
or swimmin oats will try their best to

585
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:03.520
answer your question try to get you to

586
00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.890
explain this the best we possibly can so

587
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.480
we have just a couple more things to

588
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.940
explain first of all reset is constantly

589
00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.820
connected in our case to VCC basically

590
00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.580
whenever a reset goes low so if we were

591
00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.830
to connect reset to ground it's just

592
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:19.660
going to automatically force the

593
00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.280
flip-flop to reset to the up position

594
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.100
and it'll stay in the up position until

595
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.049
our reset goes high again and it will

596
00:21:26.049 --> 00:21:28.179
allow the triple five timer to function

597
00:21:28.179 --> 00:21:30.910
again okay so how can we calculate the

598
00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:34.030
frequency of our triple five timer well

599
00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:35.380
there's a really neat equation that

600
00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.910
someone created that we can figure that

601
00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:39.610
out with basically we have frequency

602
00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:43.570
equal to one point four four divided by

603
00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:45.549
and I'm going to call this resistor a

604
00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:48.730
right here and resistor B so we have

605
00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:52.570
that divided by resistor a plus two

606
00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:56.740
times the resistor amount of B all x and

607
00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.690
we'll call the capacitance of this

608
00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:01.210
capacitor C so we're going to multiply

609
00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:03.790
that by the farad capacitance of that

610
00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.100
right there so the frequency in the

611
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.049
circuit that I built is going to be one

612
00:22:08.049 --> 00:22:11.140
point 4 4 divided by both of my

613
00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.840
resistors were four point seven K ohms

614
00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.770
so I have four thousand seven hundred

615
00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:23.679
ohms plus two times four thousand seven

616
00:22:23.679 --> 00:22:25.660
hundred ohms as well and then all of

617
00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:29.919
that is multiplied by my 470 micro farad

618
00:22:29.919 --> 00:22:33.100
capacitor so because I had 470 micro

619
00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.200
farad's and we have to make this in the

620
00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.390
fair I'd unit that is equivalent to zero

621
00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:41.410
point zero zero zero four seven farads I

622
00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:43.179
believe and actually I'm not going to

623
00:22:43.179 --> 00:22:44.559
write that F in there just to make it

624
00:22:44.559 --> 00:22:46.510
more readable so if I do the calculation

625
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:49.570
I should have the frequency that my

626
00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:51.790
output was oscillating at so when I do

627
00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:54.130
calculate that I get my frequency to

628
00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:57.970
equal approximately zero point two one

629
00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.809
seven Hertz which is abbreviated Hz and

630
00:23:01.809 --> 00:23:03.970
that basically means how many times per

631
00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:06.610
second is this cycle happening so I had

632
00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:08.980
a very very slow oscillation because I

633
00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.950
used such a big capacitance value so my

634
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:13.510
light wasn't even blinking on and off

635
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.340
once per second it was doing it even

636
00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:17.620
slower than that but if we reduced the

637
00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:19.750
capacitance value so if this value got

638
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:21.910
lower then our frequency would increase

639
00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:24.070
or if these resistance values got lower

640
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:26.440
than our frequency would increase and it

641
00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.720
would be faster and faster so you should

642
00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.520
probably try and experiment around with

643
00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.440
your resistor and capacitance values

644
00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.059
there that way you can see all different

645
00:23:34.059 --> 00:23:35.860
frequencies with your triple five timer

646
00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.809
again I hope I explained this all well

647
00:23:37.809 --> 00:23:39.340
enough for you guys any questions leave

648
00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.230
them down below in the comments this is

649
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:43.240
really fun we are getting into the meat

650
00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.250
and potatoes of this 8-bit computer

651
00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:47.380
series now we just have to cover a few

652
00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.120
more basic concepts until we actually

653
00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.429
get into designing the 8-bit computer

654
00:23:51.429 --> 00:23:52.780
thanks for watching everyone and I'll

655
00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:55.980
see you guys in the next video
