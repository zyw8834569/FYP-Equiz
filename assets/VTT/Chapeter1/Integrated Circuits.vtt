00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.470
integrated circuits in this module you

2
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.820
will learn about the types and

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.570
construction of ICS earlier the size of

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.680
computers used to be very big however

5
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.470
nowadays laptop computers and palmtop

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.519
computers are available wondering what

7
00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.460
made the miniatures a ssin of electronic

8
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.660
gadgets possible

9
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.859
the answer is AI seats IC stands for

10
00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.800
integrated circuits integrated circuits

11
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.340
IC have a big role to play in the

12
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.739
miniatures a ssin of electronic gadgets

13
00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.379
earlier the electronic circuits were

14
00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.110
prepared using transistors diodes and

15
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.140
resistors by joining those using

16
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.129
conducting wires because of this these

17
00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.680
circuits were huge and bulky further

18
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.340
these circuits were not reliable so an

19
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.160
attempt was made to fabricate an entire

20
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.769
circuit consisting of many components

21
00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.979
such as diodes resistors inductors

22
00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.820
capacitors on a small single block of a

23
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.490
semiconductor connected with the help of

24
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.250
metal strips this gave rise to the

25
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.780
concept of integrated circuits IC I C's

26
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.909
are found in almost all gadgets like

27
00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.670
cars televisions CD players and cell

28
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.240
phones the size of an IC is about one

29
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.479
millimeter by one millimeter being so

30
00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.530
small in size ICS have made the

31
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.610
miniaturization of electronic gadgets

32
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.549
possible ICS can be grouped into

33
00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.250
categories depending on the nature of

34
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.670
input signals they are a linear or

35
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.009
analog ICS and B digital ICS in linear

36
00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.219
ICS the input signals are analog signals

37
00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.340
which change smoothly and continuously

38
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.009
over a range of values between a maximum

39
00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:02.880
and a minimum

40
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.520
in this case the output is almost

41
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.429
directly proportional to the input that

42
00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.230
is it varies linearly with the input

43
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.480
operational amplifier is an example of

44
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.290
linear IC in digital ICS the input

45
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.540
signals are digital signals that have

46
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.629
only two values they contain circuits

47
00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.180
such as logic gates based on the number

48
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.599
of logic gates present in it Digital ICS

49
00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.300
can be further classified as SSI MSI LSI

50
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:43.950
and VLSI SSI small-scale integration has

51
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.310
less than 10 logic gates per square

52
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.629
millimeter MSI medium scale integration

53
00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.510
chips have less than hundred logic gates

54
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.580
per square millimeter

55
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.620
LSI large-scale integration chips have

56
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.590
100 to 1000 logic gates per square

57
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.920
millimeter VLSI very large-scale

58
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.879
integration chips have more than 1,000

59
00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.909
logic gates per square millimeter let us

60
00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.190
now have a look at the steps followed in

61
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.150
the manufacturing of ICS firstly a wafer

62
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.470
of n-type semiconductor is taken and

63
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.480
photolithography technique is used in

64
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.239
this technique firstly a layer of

65
00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.290
silicon dioxide insulator is coated over

66
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.470
it then a thin layer of photoresist and

67
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.849
material is placed over silicon dioxide

68
00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.030
after this masking is done and

69
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.459
ultraviolet light is made incident on it

70
00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.159
whenever the light is incident over the

71
00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.159
photo resistive portion it becomes hard

72
00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.470
and no chemical reaction can take place

73
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.099
over it next silicon dioxide is removed

74
00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.819
with the help of the etching process

75
00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.280
lastly the required impurities are added

76
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.379
the process is repeated to obtain

77
00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.110
different geometries require to complete

78
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.409
a chip circuit design the internal

79
00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:15.360
connection between the components is

80
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.339
made by passing alum

81
00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:20.010
vaper the chip is enclosed in a

82
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.760
protective plastic case finally with the

83
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.190
help of thin aluminium leads the

84
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.070
connectors are taken out and this is how

85
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.430
the standard package IC is manufactured

86
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.669
this type of IC in which the entire

87
00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.979
circuit is formed on a single silicon

88
00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.210
crystal is called monolithic IC these

89
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.690
are the most widely used isyes large

90
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.240
number of monolithic IC is embedded on a

91
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.130
ceramic substrate is known as hybrid IC

92
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.190
let's recap icees integrated circuits

93
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.889
have made the miniaturization of

94
00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.620
electronic gadgets possible ICS are

95
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.870
found in almost all gadgets like cars

96
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.380
televisions CD players and cell phones

97
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.720
ICS can be grouped into two categories

98
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.250
depending on the nature of input signals

99
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.139
a linear or analog I C's B digital ICS

100
00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.650
in linear I sees the input signals are

101
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.410
analog signals which change smoothly and

102
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.930
continuously over a range of values

103
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.210
between a maximum and a minimum in

104
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.360
digital ICS the signals are digital

105
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.660
signals that have only two values they

106
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.700
contain circuits such as logic gates

107
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.010
based on the number of logic gates

108
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.039
present in it Digital ICS can be further

109
00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:46.680
classified as SSI MSI LSI and VLSI to

110
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.010
