00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:02.760
if you ever opened up an electronic

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.730
device you have seen not one but more

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.490
than one I see which is in my case a

4
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.679
microcontroller I see from a DVD player

5
00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.400
or you can say a PWM I see on a power

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.400
supply even if I say like this that

7
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.039
electronics is incomplete without an IC

8
00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.519
then it is correct because IC is like

9
00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.730
the backbone in electronic circuits so

10
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.800
in this episode we are going to study

11
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.980
about ICS we will discuss about what is

12
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.210
an IC how it works and where to use them

13
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.129
so without wasting any more time let's

14
00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:55.199
get started the full form of IC is most

15
00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.780
of you probably know is integrated

16
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.989
circuit so to make one of this IC you

17
00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.219
will need thousands of electronic

18
00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.290
components like resistor capacitor diode

19
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.380
and transistors they are directly formed

20
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.750
onto a sheet of silicon so they get a

21
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.290
shape of an IC now if we talk about

22
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.750
their types they are divided into two

23
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.390
groups the first one is a square I see

24
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.799
like this atmega328 one Arduino Nano you

25
00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.930
can see that it has spins on all the

26
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.840
four sides which is in some ICS contain

27
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.299
it depends and in some i sees it

28
00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.970
contains hundred pins even these pins

29
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.670
reach more than 500

30
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.340
the second type of IC is a square I see

31
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.250
like this grandfather of all Isis any

32
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.830
triple five timer you see it has spins

33
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.560
on only two sides that's why it is

34
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.010
called rectangular I see so have a look

35
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.200
at this if I would ask you how many

36
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.750
electronic components like resistor

37
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.460
capacitor diode and transistors are they

38
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.190
in this IC then it would impossible for

39
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.800
you to guess the amount so if we take a

40
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.110
look at the internal schematic of any

41
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.630
triple five timer you can see there are

42
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.410
a total of 23 transistors 15 resistors

43
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.930
and a couple of diodes you see how the

44
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.360
managed to fix all these 23 transistors

45
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.200
and 15 resistors in this small IC

46
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.190
although if you are thinking you can

47
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.350
break this IC and see all those

48
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.050
components they are formed onto a sheet

49
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.989
of silicon in such a way that we cannot

50
00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.769
see with our naked eye now the question

51
00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.290
is what is the fun of making these ICS

52
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.700
if we can make one

53
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.640
by using schematic diagram so if I would

54
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.829
follow the schematic diagram and make

55
00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.200
the whole circuit by using same amount

56
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.110
of resistors and transistors then it

57
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.360
would take the entire breadboard to make

58
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.000
the whole circuit that's why I do two

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.310
advancement in technology they pack this

60
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.549
rather big circuit in a very small IC so

61
00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.769
we can use the circuit in a very less

62
00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.820
space at last let me clear one thing

63
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.549
from my mind in these isis there exist

64
00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.930
opponents like transistors resistors

65
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.269
capacitors diodes Fe T's and MOSFETs etc

66
00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.640
but there does not contain coils and

67
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.030
transformers take a look at any IC you

68
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.340
can see resistor capacitors but you

69
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.310
cannot see coil and transformers the

70
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.380
reason for that is due to their large

71
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.470
size making them small in size is very

72
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.299
expensive as compared with other

73
00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.390
components like resistors capacitors so

74
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.670
designers avoid to use them in ICS

75
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.769
that's why we have to use those

76
00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.140
components externally in our circus

77
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.540
so finally friends let's end this topic

78
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.580

apparently this video is not that

83
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.820
special but it is useful for all those

84
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.650
