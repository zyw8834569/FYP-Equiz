I am Katie with your Galco TV tech tip

2
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.380
an integrated circuit also referred to

3
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.010
as an IC is an electronic circuit formed

4
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.380
on a small piece of semiconducting

5
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.410
material performing the same function as

6
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.689
a larger circuit made from discrete

7
00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.079
components an IC is a collection of

8
00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.290
electronic components resistors

9
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.020
transistors capacitors etc all stuffed

10
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.660
into a tiny chip and connected together

11
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.510
to achieve a common goal integrated

12
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.239
circuits can be categorized as analog

13
00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.899
digital or a combination of both analog

14
00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.660
ICS work by processing continuous

15
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.260
signals they perform functions like

16
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.809
amplification active filtering

17
00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.750
demodulation and mixing digital ICS

18
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.630
operate only at a few defined levels

19
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.210
instead of operating over all levels of

20
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.240
signal amplitude they are designed by

21
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.310
using multiple numbers of digital logic

22
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.490
gates multiplexer flip-flops and other

23
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.580
electronic components of circuits these

24
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.280
logic gates work with binary input data

25
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.340
or digital input data these devices are

26
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.710
used in computers computer networks

27
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.549
modems and frequency counters integrated

28
00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.320
circuits that combine both analog and

29
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.860
digital ICS on a single chip are called

30
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.799
mixed IC use these functions as digital

31
00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.520
to analog converters analog to digital

32
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.790
converters and class timing ICS the most

33
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.640
common example of a modern IC is the

34
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.369
computer processor which consists of

35
00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.670
billions of fabricated transistors logic

36
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.579
gates and other digital circuitry now if

37
00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.259
you have any questions that you would

38
00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.390
like to ask us you can do so at our

39
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.729
technical help forums that's located at

40
00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.300
forums also calm or for more information
