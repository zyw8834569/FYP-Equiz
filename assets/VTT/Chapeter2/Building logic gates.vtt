1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.680
at the core of every computer are

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.720
devices that actually perform the

3
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.660
computations in most modern computers we

4
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.269
either use n Mo's and P Mo's transistors

5
00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.700
as the base of most of our operations

6
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.759
and in this lecture we'll be focusing on

7
00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.609
how we use these to gate our transistors

8
00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.170
to create logic gates now this is the N

9
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.820
Mo's transistor itself inside this

10
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.660
circle and we have some dimensions of

11
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.070
how we use it so we connect this lower

12
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.859
terminal terminal 2 to ground it's

13
00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.780
sufficient just so you know that this is

14
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.969
the convention and you can explore why

15
00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.579
in future courses and then we have a

16
00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.070
gate which is our inputs and that's how

17
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.020
we control the transistor from our

18
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.210
perspective and that'll be a 0 or a 1

19
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.000
and then this terminal 1 connects to

20
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.539
other gates or the output of our logic

21
00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.350
gate and then we've got our P Mo's

22
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.440
transistor over here which behaves in a

23
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.210
opposite fashion we have our our

24
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.309
transistor here and notice this little

25
00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.000
symbol that tells us this is the p MOS

26
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.820
transistor and we connect terminal 1

27
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.180
here to this high voltage VDD which is

28
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.430
usually like about 1 volt but that's

29
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.119
going to be very based on the technology

30
00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.560
and then we have our input gate which

31
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.400
allows us to control this transistor and

32
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.280
then terminal 2 connects out to other

33
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.759
circuits or other logic gates and so how

34
00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.759
do we actually make these work and what

35
00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.579
these actually do and so basically a

36
00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.549
transistor is a electrically controlled

37
00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.350
switch if we put a 1 in or a high

38
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.100
voltage the end loss becomes a closed

39
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.530
circuit whereas the p MOS becomes an

40
00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.409
open circuit and if we were to switch of

41
00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.390
let's expose the second longer so when

42
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.240
this is closed or shorted there's a

43
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.959
direct path from ground up to here so

44
00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.450
basically our output terminal has a zero

45
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.920
volt output

46
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.200
whereas this guy since there's a an

47
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.900
open-circuit there's no current or

48
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.209
anything going through this and so this

49
00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.040
is just basically a dangling wire

50
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.480
there's nothing there's nothing not

51
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.850
connected to anything however if we

52
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.550
switch our inputs the entire behavior

53
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.490
changes our end loss becomes an open and

54
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.580
our PMO's becomes a short and so now

55
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.160
there's a direct path between our output

56
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.980
and VDD so now this is going to be our

57
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.340
high voltage VDD and we can keep

58
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.870
altering these behaviors being

59
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.640
alternating between zero and once and

60
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.340
because they have opposite functionality

61
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.670
we call them complementary and

62
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.709
complementary Moss or CMOS is how we

63
00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.500
talk about NMOS and PMO's as a group and

64
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.390
any other type of logic that has a

65
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.870
similar functionality the amazing thing

66
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.100
is that we can use just a PMO's and NMOS

67
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.769
transistors to create any circuit and so

68
00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.560
here we have a not gate and we'll show

69
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.780
you how this works

70
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.760
if we have an input of zero

71
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.470
our p-type is going to become a short

72
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.640
and directly connect the output to VDD

73
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.700
so when our input is zero volts our

74
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.010
outputs going to have VDD volts which is

75
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.400
a logical one on the other hand this

76
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.780
this n-type is going to be open so

77
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.820
there's no connection between our output

78
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.579
and ground for if we input a 1 or VDD

79
00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.570
volts we have a direct path between

80
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.000
ground and the output so our output is

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.410
going to have zero volts and be a

82
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.860
logical zero and our p-type is going to

83
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.329
become an open so there's no connection

84
00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:14.940
between VDD and the output and so this

85
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.130
is how we build our not gate which has

86
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.910
this symbol

87
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.950
when we build more complicated or

88
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.310
complex digital logic circuits it

89
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.480
becomes important to notice there's

90
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.430
another part of what makes these guys

91
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.780
complementary so down here n MOS

92
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.030
transistors are connected in series

93
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.390
that means the up power output of one is

94
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.140
connected to the terminal of the other

95
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.710
whereas our PMO's up here are connected

96
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.710
in parallel where both of their outputs

97
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.000
are connected together and they're both

98
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.580
connected on their terminals to VDD and

99
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.800
this these differing paths this parallel

100
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.170
path versus series path is really

101
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.210
important that any time you have a PMO's

102
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.220
in parallel you need to have an n MOS in

103
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.440
series if you have a PMO's and series

104
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.570
you have an N Moss in parallel and

105
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.180
that's how we build our logic gates so

106
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.680
that we maintain this complementary

107
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.410
functionality now let's look at what

108
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.970
this circuit actually does

109
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.920
so let's input a is 0 B is 0 so an a is

110
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.730
0 this p MOS is going to be a short and

111
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.570
when B is 0 this p MOS is going to be a

112
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.560
short as well and so both these connect

113
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.640
our output directly to VDD so our output

114
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.050
should be a 1 and down here our a is

115
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.030
connected to our n MOS so that's going

116
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.310
to become and open and B is going to be

117
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.750
connect to this n moss and create an

118
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.730
open so there's no path between ground

119
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.820
and the output so indeed our output is 1

120
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.140
and let's try another input combination

121
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.620
so let's try with 0 1 and when a is 0

122
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.750
we're going to have a short on this p

123
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.530
MOS just like before and with b is 1

124
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.180
this is going to create an open on this

125
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.780
p MOS

126
00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.960
a with 0 is going to create an open on

127
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.620
this n MOS and B with the 1 is going to

128
00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.430
create a short so here our ground is

129
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.250
still cut off from the output but we do

130
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.340
have a direct path from VDD down to the

131
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.150
output so output is going to be 1 now

132
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.030
let's try the next combination 1 0 this

133
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.040
is going to be exactly like the

134
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.380
for except a little bit flipped so a is

135
00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.540
going to result in this being open this

136
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.840
B is going to cause us to be short and

137
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.430
then this a is going to cause this n

138
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.640
Mo's to be shorted and this B with zero

139
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.040
is going to cause us and MAS to be open

140
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.590
so again there's no path between ground

141
00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.960
in the output but there will be a path

142
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.230
between VDD and the output so the output

143
00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:02.280
is 1 all right one last combination to

144
00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:07.110
go we got a is 1 B is 1 that means a is

145
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.270
going to be an open on this P Moss B is

146
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.190
going to be an open on this P Moss and

147
00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.310
then a is going to result in a short on

148
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.830
this n Moss and B is going to result in

149
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.170
a short on this n Moss so now we have a

150
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.620
path between ground and the output so

151
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.500
our output is 0 and we have no paths

152
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:29.580
between VDD and the output so that

153
00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.060
reinforces that this is a 0 if you

154
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.410
recognize this truth table you should

155
00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.500
recognize that this is the NAND function

156
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.080
the not and which has the following

157
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:45.270
circuit symbol we can now use this NAND

158
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.940
gate that we constructed to create a

159
00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.240
NAND gate if we just competin a this

160
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.850
knot afterwards so we've got our NAND

161
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:59.580
and this is our knot and this would

162
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.210
result in a B is our inputs C has our

163
00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.670
outputs for a NAND gate this is one

164
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.410
reason why we tend to use only NAND

165
00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.660
gates in our implementation of actual

166
00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.090
computers because an and gate is a lot

167
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.970
more complicated well anyways we'll find

168
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.140
out more about that in future lectures

169
00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.510
as well so let's look at one last

170
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:21.300
circuit and I'll just give the punchline

171
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.030
away for this one this is an or gate and

172
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.500
we'll see exactly how this behaves I

173
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.360
want to draw attention back to the

174
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.780
series versus parallel here our p MOS

175
00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:36.990
are in series whereas our n MOS down on

176
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.990
the bottom here are in parallel because

177
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.059
they share that common point over here

178
00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:45.480
and so that should hopefully reinforce

179
00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.030
the idea that we always do things

180
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.720
complementarily

181
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.750
PMO's and NMOS so let's look at the

182
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:56.339
inputs when Z a is 0 B is 0 a creates a

183
00:08:56.339 --> 00:08:58.500
short on the PMO's B creates a short on

184
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.829
this PMO's and then the a comes around

185
00:09:01.829 --> 00:09:03.420
here and creates an open on the N Moss

186
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.870
and B creates an open on this end Moss

187
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.209
so we have a direct connection between

188
00:09:08.209 --> 00:09:11.939
VDD and the output and no path between

189
00:09:11.939 --> 00:09:15.829
ground and the output so output is 1

190
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:18.000
let's try the next simple combination

191
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.149
with 0 1 0 creates a short here and an

192
00:09:24.149 --> 00:09:28.829
open here so there's no path between VDD

193
00:09:28.829 --> 00:09:32.550
and the output and then we've got 0 over

194
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:36.300
here so this guy's becomes an open but

195
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:40.259
to be being one here casein up short for

196
00:09:40.259 --> 00:09:42.000
this n Moss so we have a path directly

197
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.040
from ground to the output so that

198
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.610
creates a 0 output next input

199
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:52.920
combination 1 0 B is 1 so we have a open

200
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.069
here and a short on this PMO's because

201
00:09:56.069 --> 00:09:58.139
of the B and then this guy is going to

202
00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:02.699
be open and this guy will be shorted so

203
00:10:02.699 --> 00:10:04.410
now we have a different path but we

204
00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.420
still have a path nonetheless from

205
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.430
ground to the output so our output be 0

206
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:14.939
and then we put both these as 1 both of

207
00:10:14.939 --> 00:10:18.480
our p mosses will be open and both of

208
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.000
our n mosses will be shorted so we have

209
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.809
two paths from ground to the output so C

210
00:10:24.809 --> 00:10:28.439
will be 0 and our output will be 0 and

211
00:10:28.439 --> 00:10:31.290
this again creates our nor gate which

212
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:37.110
has the circuit symbol nor and we can

213
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.110
combine nor with not to create or and

214
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:43.470
just like our NAND art we generally will

215
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.569
prefer to use nor gates exclusively in

216
00:10:45.569 --> 00:10:47.879
our designs rather than using and ORS

217
00:10:47.879 --> 00:10:50.300
and nots
