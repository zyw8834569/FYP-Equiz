00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.779
hi I'm Karen and this is the learning

2
00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.130
circuit where we learn about basic

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.559
electronics diving into electronics for

4
00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.330
the first time can be daunting I'm going

5
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.860
to show you how to make a basic circuit

6
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.480
out of common materials and components

7
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.190
to help get you started before we make a

8
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.050
circuit let's talk about what a circuit

9
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.140
is a circuit is a closed path through

10
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.000
which an electric current can flow a

11
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.609
circuit can be closed or open if the

12
00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.890
circuit is closed all of the components

13
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.900
are connected and the electrical current

14
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.870
can flow if the circuit is open then a

15
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.180
connection is broken and the electrical

16
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.760
current cannot flow we use circuits to

17
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.520
send energy to turn things on like the

18
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.440
motor in this drill or the bulb in this

19
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.570
flashlight a lot of things we use every

20
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.579
day contains circuits and circuit boards

21
00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.590
here's an example of a circuit board it

22
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.270
contains lots of little circuits that

23
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.039
each have their own individual function

24
00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.680
for example one circuit might turn on

25
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.230
this motor another circuit might make

26
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.180
this buzzer beep but not all circuits

27
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.190
have to be this complicated we can make

28
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.349
a simple circuit out of just a light

29
00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.900
bulb a power source and some wires let's

30
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.549
look at the materials we'll need to make

31
00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.740
this circuit you'll want some cardboard

32
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.010
some paper clips some paper fasteners a

33
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.330
battery some tape and a light it would

34
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.040
also be useful if you have a pair of

35
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.000
needlenose pliers

36
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.640
and a utility knife circuits typically

37
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.950
use wires and circuit traces to send

38
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.689
electricity and signals along the

39
00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.430
circuit today we're going to be using

40
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.439
the paper clips and the paper fasteners

41
00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.110
in place of wires now it's important to

42
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.000
make sure that these items are metal and

43
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.100
don't have any coating we need them to

44
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.380
be conductive so that electricity flows

45
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.540
through them wherever they touch for

46
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.460
this project we'll use a battery as the

47
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.040
power source batteries have a positive

48
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.890
and a negative terminal some components

49
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.899
only work in one direction so it's

50
00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.270
important to note which orientation your

51
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.189
battery is being hooked up this battery

52
00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.189
supplies 1.5 volts of power when

53
00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.750
choosing our light we want to make sure

54
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.340
that we choose one that is rated for low

55
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.619
voltage if the lights rated for 2 to 3

56
00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.479
volts it should still work with one

57
00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.360
battery ok let's make a circuit first

58
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.730
I'm going to tape down my battery now

59
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.650
I'm going to add a paper clip to either

60
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.019
side to act as the wires to conduct the

61
00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.269
electricity as well as acting as clips

62
00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.010
to help hold the battery in place I'll

63
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.599
use a pair of needlenose pliers to bend

64
00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.819
it in half then put it right against the

65
00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.860
battery and push a fastener right at the

66
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.900
other end to help hold it snugly in

67
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.590
place next we're gonna add our light now

68
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.450
the length of the paper clips is going

69
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.709
to determine where this is going to go

70
00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.359
and if you need to you can add extra

71
00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:38.579
paper clips and fasteners to make sure

72
00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.319
that it reaches I'm gonna make a loop of

73
00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.060
tape to put on the bottom of my light

74
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.890
just stick it down to the cardboard now

75
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.239
I want to make sure that the screws of

76
00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.340
the light are facing out towards my

77
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.690
paper clips so that it's easy to reach

78
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.760
my last paper clips I'm gonna loop

79
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.190
around the screws of the light socket

80
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.680
and then try to connect the ends over to

81
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.420
my other paper clips and then secure

82
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.220
them with a fastener remember you want

83
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.659
to make sure that you're using the

84
00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.549
fasteners to pull the paper clips tight

85
00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:03.900
so that you have a nice secure

86
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.239
connection alright we've made a circuit

87
00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.470
if you have everything hooked up

88
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.389
correctly your light should be on if

89
00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.340
your lights not on here's some places

90
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.170
you can look for troubleshooting check

91
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.000
all of your connections make sure that

92
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.889
metal stays touching metal when not

93
00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.799
being held if not bend it more or try

94
00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.629
adding some tape make sure you're using

95
00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.209
a fresh battery my favorite test to see

96
00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.220
if a batteries good or not is to drop it

97
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.590
and first on a hard surface if the

98
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.169
battery bounces the inside is dry and

99
00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.970
the battery's probably dead if it

100
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.010
doesn't bounce it should still have some

101
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.019
power it's not the most accurate method

102
00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.180
but it's a quick test you can do that

103
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.590
doesn't require a multimeter or a

104
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.569
battery tester if your circuit still

105
00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.459
doesn't work take a look at the bulb

106
00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.190
inside the bulb is a filament if the

107
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.709
filament is broken that turns it into an

108
00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.750
open circuit because electricity cannot

109
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.569
flow across it replace the bulb with one

110
00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.359
where the filament is intact lastly you

111
00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:58.560
need to make sure that your light bulb

112
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.629
is screwed all the way in there needs to

113
00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.370
be a way for electricity to flow into

114
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.799
and out of the light bulb one of those

115
00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.470
points is the threads on the screw the

116
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.510
other point is the bottom of the light

117
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.519
bulb both of those points have to be

118
00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.590
touching the socket for electricity to

119
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.879
be able to flow through the light bulb

120
00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.858
for this project I prefer to use

121
00:04:16.858 --> 00:04:18.870
incandescent bulbs because they're less

122
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.449
sensitive to voltages if this light bulb

123
00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.029
is rated for 3 volts it will still turn

124
00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:26.880
on and glow at a lower voltage and

125
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.680
can handle higher voltages before

126
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.570
burning out if you'd like to use LEDs

127
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.030
for this project instead there are some

128
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.160
things you need to know first LEDs come

129
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.260
in different sizes here is a three

130
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.660
millimeter a five millimeter and a ten

131
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.210
millimeter LED LEDs are more sensitive

132
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.130
to voltages than incandescent bulbs

133
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.050
another difference is that with

134
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.180
incandescent bulbs orientation in the

135
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.610
circuit doesn't matter LED stands for

136
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.130
light emitting diode a diode is an

137
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.720
electrical component that only lets

138
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.490
electricity flow through it in one

139
00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.100
direction an LED will not work if it is

140
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.230
hooked up backwards you can identify the

141
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.390
negative side of an LED a few different

142
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.640
ways sometimes the negative side is flat

143
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.550
like on this five millimeter LED usually

144
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.920
the negative lead is shorter and lastly

145
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.590
if you look inside the LED the larger

146
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.320
side is the negative side let's get back

147
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.120
to the circuit I want to add one more

148
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.460
thing a switch but the good news is you

149
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.750
don't actually have to add anything to

150
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.670
the circuit if there is a break in the

151
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.980
circle the circuit becomes open and the

152
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.840
light turns off when we do this on

153
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.270
purpose we create a switch in our

154
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.950
circuit you can loosen one of the paper

155
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.020
clips so it just touches the top of the

156
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.540
fastener then it can swivel and easily

157
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.400
open and close to become a switch

158
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.410
opening and closing the circuit

159
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.900
you might notice on other switches that

160
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.880
there's a line on one side and a circle

161
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.430
on the other that represents a closed or

162
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.650
open circuit when the switch is

163
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.440
positioned to the o side that represents

164
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.140
an open circuit and it's off when we

165
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.790
position the switch to the line side

166
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.430
that represents a closed circuit and the

167
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.650
switch is on I hope that helps you

168
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.480
understand open and close circuits and

169
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.790
how switches work within them after

170
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.350
you've made your own cardboard circuits

171
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.570
tell us about it did you have any

172
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.610
problems did you discover something new

173
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.590
did you figure out a better way to make

174
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.050
them post your comments questions and

175
