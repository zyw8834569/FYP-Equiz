00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.520
hello this is module 4.3

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.400
mosfet dc characterization so the

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.000
coverage of this module

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.440
is shown here so it is mosfet

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.880
fundamentals

6
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.279
i'm calculating voltages between mosfet

7
00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.960
terminals determining regions of

8
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.080
operation

9
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.160
drain current calculation and mosfet

10
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.359
characterization with bias circuits

11
00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.400
so in this slide

12
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.119
it shows the pmos and the nmos

13
00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.079
transistors

14
00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.160
symbols and as you can see

15
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.520
um there is a gate terminal a source in

16
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.960
a drain terminal

17
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.559
and same here

18
00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.960
what is important when you calculate

19
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.000
mosfet circuits

20
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
is to discern the voltages vgs and vds

21
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.840
for nmos and vsg and vsd for pmos

22
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.160
so due to the oxide present in the gate

23
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.120
terminal in mosfet so remember that

24
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.680
in in the physics structure of a mosfet

25
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.760
there's an oxide here and oxide there

26
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.080
and then oxide is effectively an

27
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.280
insulator

28
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.960
so therefore gate current is zero

29
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.759
so if git current is zero we can say

30
00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:16.640
that is

31
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.759
equals id same here

32
00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.119
and therefore compared to bjts there is

33
00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.640
only one current

34
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.080
to be calculated for mosfets

35
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.240
another thing to note here is to

36
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.040
remember the positioning of the arrow

37
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.040
because the arrow defines where the

38
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.479
source is

39
00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.240
for either nmos and pmos so for a pmos

40
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.600
the arrow is going in and for the nmos

41
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.399
it's going out

42
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.119
so guide in solving mosfet circuits so

43
00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.280
how do you solve mosfet circuits

44
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.520
well the first step is to identify the

45
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.320
gate

46
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.600
the source and the drain terminals

47
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.159
so as as i've said earlier the terminal

48
00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.040
with an arrow

49
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.520
outward if nmos and inward the pmos is

50
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.759
always the source the other terminal

51
00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:06.399
without an

52
00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.399
arrow is always the drain and the

53
00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.560
terminal in between the mosfet

54
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.000
is the gate so the next step if you

55
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.720
if you are successful in identifying the

56
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.000
terminals

57
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.319
so solve for the important voltages

58
00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.000
across the terminals of the transistor

59
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.840
using fundamental circuit techniques

60
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.040
take note

61
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.840
of the voltage polarities so remember

62
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.319
the nmos and the pmos

63
00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.000
they have different polarities

64
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.440
when calculating so remember

65
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.519
vsvgs and vds for nmos and vsg

66
00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.200
and vsd for pmos next step

67
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.040
from the voltages determine the

68
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.280
operating region of the transistor

69
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.680
and identify the applicable during

70
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.200
current equation

71
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.239
so if you want if you want to

72
00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.360
master this this part you revis you can

73
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.920
revisit module 4.2

74
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.120
for determining the operating region so

75
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.000
now

76
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.840
just take note of these two some

77
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.840
problems will give the operating regions

78
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.840
given or a required design choice

79
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.360
take note of this if the operating

80
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.959
region can't be determined

81
00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.760
or if you calculated vgs and vds and

82
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.280
they are dependent on

83
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.519
some variables and there is no fixed

84
00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.560
value

85
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.319
assume that the transistor is in

86
00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.920
saturation and check

87
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.879
if this assumption is correct so see

88
00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:31.840
some um

89
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.840
we're gonna discuss the third sample

90
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.360
problem to show

91
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.400
this uh guide this part of the guide

92
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.879
so the next step is if you have

93
00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.480
determined the correct

94
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.319
drain current equation use this equation

95
00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.760
to solve for the drink current of the

96
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.599
mosfet

97
00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.720
so take note of the current direction

98
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.120
and parameter units remember that there

99
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.680
is no current going to or from the gate

100
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.799
e ig is equal to zero and then from this

101
00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.239
current equation

102
00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.760
you can use these equations

103
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.519
to solve for other quantities needed in

104
00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.840
the mosfet circuit

105
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.959
so um in to show

106
00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.879
this guide to show the effectiveness of

107
00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.040
this kind we will calculate some

108
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.680
example problems so the first sample

109
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.560
problem

110
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.400
so given that the enmotion sister is

111
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.040
characterized to have 2000 microamps per

112
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.160
volt squared

113
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.320
and vth equals 0.4 volts and the

114
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.680
transistor is biased with vx equals 0.8

115
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.080
find the region's operation the drain

116
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.120
current

117
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.520
if channeler modulation is negligible

118
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.440
and drain current if there is channel

119
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.680
and modulation and characterized to have

120
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.199
this parameter

121
00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.800
so the first question the region of

122
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.400
operation

123
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.280
so the first step is to discern vgs and

124
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.800
vds so remember

125
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.759
that the arrow is always the source the

126
00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:57.280
terminal with an arrow is always the

127
00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.240
source

128
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.160
and the terminal without an arrow is the

129
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.440
drain and the

130
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.479
middle is the gate so you calculate vgs

131
00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.479
so it's vx minus zero and calculate

132
00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.759
pds which is five volts minus zero so as

133
00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:14.639
you can see it's here

134
00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.320
and then remember that we must find the

135
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.520
region of operation

136
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.120
so for this example this transistor

137
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.759
is in the saturation region because vgs

138
00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.840
is greater than vth

139
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.600
and vds is greater than vgs minus vth

140
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.400
which is

141
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.759
shown here so because it is in such

142
00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:39.840
in the saturation region

143
00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.560
we can calculate the drain current so

144
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.160
because the channel length modulation is

145
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.639
negligible we will use this equation

146
00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:49.280
which does not include the channel

147
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.199
length modulation

148
00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:53.360
and then we substitute the values shown

149
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.800
here

150
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.039
as you can see the process

151
00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:59.120
transconductance is 2 000 micrograms per

152
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.560
volt squared

153
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.800
and then vx vgs is vx minus 0. so it's

154
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.440
0.8

155
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.759
minus vth and then we calculate we get

156
00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:10.880
160 microamps

157
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.560
and then if we want to calculate the

158
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.400
the current when there is channel

159
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.680
modulation we will use this equation

160
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.880
now this we include this part which

161
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.800
considers the channel length modulation

162
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.479
and then we substitute all the values

163
00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:31.199
here so 2000

164
00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:34.319
uh the process transconductance kn

165
00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:37.360
and then vgs is 0.8 vth is 0.4

166
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.720
and then we substitute the channel

167
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.960
modulation parameter and vds

168
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.440
and then you get 176 micrograms so as

169
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.400
you can see

170
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.560
because there is channel and modulation

171
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.680
the drain current

172
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.280
is increased now

173
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.880
let's move on to the second sample

174
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.720
problem so now we have a pmos transistor

175
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.840
so it has a uh processor conductance so

176
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.240
4500 microamps per volt squared

177
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.880
and vth is negative 0.8 volts and its

178
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.840
bias with vm equals 0.8

179
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.680
so we need to find the resistance of

180
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.280
resistor rb so that v out is 2.8

181
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.720
assume channel length modulation is

182
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.120
negligible so the first step

183
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.160
is to discern vgs and vds

184
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.759
or for this pmos is sg and sd

185
00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:26.479
so what are we gonna do first step is to

186
00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:27.039
find the

187
00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:29.120
region of operation so for the drain

188
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.479
current and then

189
00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:33.520
solve for the resistance using ohm's law

190
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.520
so first step find the transistor's

191
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.800
region operation

192
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.360
so vsg is shown here so it's 3 volts

193
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.479
minus value of vm which is 0.8

194
00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:48.160
so we get 2.2 and vsd we want

195
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.599
the value to be 2.8 here

196
00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:54.160
so therefore it's 3 volts minus 2.8 to

197
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.840
be 0.2

198
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.800
so as you can see from this voltages we

199
00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.440
can now

200
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.120
find the region of operation because vgs

201
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.919
or vsg for the pmos is greater than vthp

202
00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:10.879
as you can see here and then the vsd is

203
00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:13.280
between 0 and vsg minus the absolute

204
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.199
value of bthp

205
00:08:15.199 --> 00:08:17.199
so therefore this one is in the linear

206
00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:19.599
region

207
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.160
so because the pmos is operating in the

208
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.080
linear or the tried region use the

209
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:24.879
equation

210
00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.960
this one so this is the equation for a

211
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.430
linear

212
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:28.720
[Music]

213
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.879
for the pmos operating in the linear

214
00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:32.640
region

215
00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.958
so remember that this is ids and it's

216
00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:35.839
negative

217
00:08:35.839 --> 00:08:37.760
so in order for us to have a simpler

218
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.599
simpler calculation we just reverse the

219
00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:40.000
current

220
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.799
direction so this ids going there so we

221
00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:43.839
just reverse it

222
00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:46.399
so we get the positive so we use this

223
00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:46.959
equation

224
00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:51.760
isd equals kp vsg minus vt hp must be

225
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.200
the sd over 2 time all multiplied by v

226
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.320
st and then what we're gonna what we're

227
00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.680
gonna do next is to substitute

228
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.839
everything so it everything's given

229
00:09:01.839 --> 00:09:04.000
the process transconductance is here the

230
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.440
threshold is here

231
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.519
and the bias is here we substitute

232
00:09:07.519 --> 00:09:09.760
everything here and we get 1.17

233
00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.839
milliamps

234
00:09:11.839 --> 00:09:14.000
from the current calculations we can now

235
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.440
solve for the resistance

236
00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.480
using ohm's law so rb is v

237
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.080
out over the current so remember there

238
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.360
is no gate current

239
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.440
so all isd is isd also here

240
00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.200
so we substitute all the values and we

241
00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.080
get 2.39 kilo ohms

242
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.839
so now let's move on to the third

243
00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:36.240
problem this is more difficult but

244
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.800
i hope you can understand the that the

245
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.720
process is the same for any mosfet

246
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.839
circuit

247
00:09:41.839 --> 00:09:44.560
you encounter so for this one given that

248
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.839
the pmos transistor shown is

249
00:09:45.839 --> 00:09:46.959
characterized to have

250
00:09:46.959 --> 00:09:49.920
these parameters so kp is 500 microns

251
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.279
per volt squared

252
00:09:51.279 --> 00:09:54.080
and vthp is negative 0.3 volts and its

253
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:54.640
bias

254
00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.600
using a resistive divider shown here

255
00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.480
with

256
00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.720
rx equals 1 kilo ohm and roi is 2 kilo

257
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.079
ohm find the voltage v

258
00:10:02.079 --> 00:10:05.040
out if rb is 10 kilo ohms assume the

259
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:05.440
channel

260
00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.560
modulation is negligible

261
00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.880
so what's what are the steps so the

262
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.640
first step is to solve for the crucial

263
00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.120
voltages of the pmos in the circuit

264
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.040
find the region of operation calculate

265
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.880
the drain current and solve for v out

266
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.880
using ohm's law

267
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.800
so as you can see instead of having a

268
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.880
direct voltage here we have a resistive

269
00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.399
divider

270
00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:29.600
so now because there is no current

271
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.600
going into the gate so vm this one

272
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.040
can be calculated using voltage division

273
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.360
because there's no there's no gate

274
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.320
current

275
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.800
so you can see shown here so we get that

276
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.640
vm is 2 volts

277
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.200
then what's next so the next is to find

278
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.920
the transistor's region of operation

279
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.279
so if we want to find this we get vsg

280
00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:58.959
and vst so vsg is 3 volts

281
00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:01.440
minus two volts from what we calculated

282
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.040
earlier so we got one volt

283
00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.240
and then vst is three volts minus vl

284
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.200
so now here's the here's the problem

285
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.959
because the value of the

286
00:11:10.959 --> 00:11:14.240
value of vsd depends on v

287
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.480
out the region of operation can either

288
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.079
be linear or saturation

289
00:11:20.399 --> 00:11:23.120
so in cases like this if the region of

290
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.560
the operation of the transistor is not

291
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.880
definite in a characterization or design

292
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.440
problem

293
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.560
assume assume that the transistor is in

294
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.640
saturation and check the voltage results

295
00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.519
later

296
00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:35.519
if the assumption is true if the

297
00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:36.640
assumption is false

298
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.240
redo the solution with the assumption

299
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.600
that the linear is operating in the

300
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.079
linear or triad region

301
00:11:42.079 --> 00:11:44.880
so now because we don't know if this is

302
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.320
linear or saturation we're going to

303
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:46.800
assume

304
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.000
first that it is saturation

305
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.240
as shown here so because we assume that

306
00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.160
this is in saturation we're going to use

307
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.240
the ideal saturation equation of the

308
00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.000
pmos drain current

309
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.399
so channel modulation is negligible so

310
00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:01.839
this is constant

311
00:12:01.839 --> 00:12:04.880
the constant equation so we substitute

312
00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.760
everything so that the processor

313
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.240
conductance is 500 microamps per volt

314
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.279
squared

315
00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:14.560
and then vsg is 1 volt

316
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.360
from earlier and then the threshold

317
00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.000
voltage

318
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.560
is negative 0.3 remember to absolute

319
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.440
value this

320
00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.240
avoid avoid not including this because

321
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.160
this will be confusing later on

322
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.200
and you will get this value 122.5

323
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.839
microamps

324
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.040
and then we can calculate the voltage

325
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.560
using ohm's law

326
00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.560
because remember there is no gate

327
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.399
current here

328
00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:42.639
therefore all the current in here will

329
00:12:42.639 --> 00:12:44.399
be the current here

330
00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:47.200
substitute everything you will get 1.225

331
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.079
volts

332
00:12:48.079 --> 00:12:51.200
now because this answer

333
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.120
is from the assumption that the pmos is

334
00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.360
in saturation

335
00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.160
you must verify this first before you

336
00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.360
accept it as your final answer

337
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.680
so now we just redo what we did earlier

338
00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.680
so we find the transistor's region of

339
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.800
operation

340
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.000
so we get vsg is 1 volt and then vsd is

341
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.160
1.775 volts

342
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.040
so from the saturation requirements

343
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.800
shown here we must check if they are

344
00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.600
true

345
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.240
so the first one is true and the second

346
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.040
one

347
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.279
one point seven seven five is actually

348
00:13:25.279 --> 00:13:26.480
greater than one volt

349
00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.240
minus negative um point the absolute

350
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.240
value of negative point three volts

351
00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.279
therefore this answer is the correct

352
00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:36.399
answer because

353
00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:38.240
the transistor is actually in the

354
00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.279
saturation region

355
00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:44.720
so that ends this lecture
