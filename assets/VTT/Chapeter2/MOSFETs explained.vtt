00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.880
hello everybody this is a very very very

2
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.620
simple video on what a MOSFET is and

3
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.730
does a MOSFET is a

4
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.740
metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect

5
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.630
transistor and this is what it looks

6
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.840
like

7
00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.309
so this is how it looks like and it has

8
00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.430
basically three terminals the drain the

9
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.670
source and the gate now that you know

10
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.760
what it looks like let's define what a

11
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.699
MOSFET is and there are two important

12
00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.550
terms that you must know and it's right

13
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.019
in front of our faces

14
00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:58.610
the metal-oxide-semiconductor

15
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.809
field-effect transistor so the most to

16
00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.619
two terms we have to emphasize are the

17
00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.009
field effect and the transistor and

18
00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.320
that's what basically a moth MOSFET is

19
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.890
so first let's define what those terms

20
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.070
mean a field effect basically means that

21
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.409
something is caused by a certain voltage

22
00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.140
source so depending on the magnitude of

23
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.840
a voltage it would do something

24
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.649
externally a transistor the second term

25
00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.350
is something that amplifies or switched

26
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.710
electronic signals such as not only

27
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.189
signals but also current in this case so

28
00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.960
combining the field effect definition

29
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.880
and the transistor definition together

30
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.750
we now know what a MOSFET is and that it

31
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.229
is something that that can amplify or

32
00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.920
switch electronic signals that is caused

33
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.409
by a voltage source so here we have

34
00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.320
scenario here three different circuits

35
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.690
and we have a circuit where we have a

36
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.209
high voltage source and a track and then

37
00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.880
there's a ground now we have the

38
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.370
situation here where in this situation

39
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.900
the current is zero and here a little

40
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.430
bit of current is passing through the

41
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.340
ground and in this situation where a lot

42
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.310
of current is traveling to the ground

43
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.920
now what the MOSFET can do is that it

44
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.260
can do all of these kinds of scenarios

45
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.019
with its capability so in this here in

46
00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.180
this situation here it can act as a

47
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.010
switch where basically switches off

48
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.670
entirely of the circuit and no current

49
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.440
is passing

50
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.630
essentially there is infinite resistance

51
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.530
and it is a open circuit here there is

52
00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.880
very little current that is passing

53
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.030
through you know the resistance is still

54
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.970
relevant but here a lot of current is

55
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.860
flowing through and the resistance is

56
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.280
varies little and with the MOSFET and

57
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.590
use it utilizing the knowledge of field

58
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:18.570
effect an external voltage source could

59
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.980
apply to all of these conditions so

60
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.700
let's look at our MOSFET this is an N

61
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.000
type MOSFET so the symbol right here we

62
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.620
are given again and let's apply that

63
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.560
circuit into this MOSFET shall we so we

64
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.340
had that positive 10 volt here and then

65
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.170
we had here the ground now utilizing the

66
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:55.720
field effect Northey are-- what this

67
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.400
basically means is that the voltage

68
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.420
between the gate and the source is the

69
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.310
voltage that could control the current

70
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.130
passing from this part of the circuit

71
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.650
down here and it can vary as well so

72
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.970
what that basically means I'm going to

73
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.390
write it down right here that it can

74
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.380
affect these three variables so the

75
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.300
first thing that I've already mentioned

76
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.780
is the current and we can write that as

77
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.190
ID the second is the resistance between

78
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.169
D s and we call that Rd s and the third

79
00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.890
is the voltage across the drain and the

80
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.980
source VDS and that's how the field

81
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.200
effect works in this situation where the

82
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.169
voltage gate source could affect these

83
00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.490
three variables

84
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.070
so let's apply the situation and

85
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.200
conditions if the voltage vgs is low

86
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.170
then our drain current is next to zero

87
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:28.970
close to zero our resistance RDS is very

88
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.740
high high to the point where it almost

89
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:41.350
acts as an open circuit and also VDS is

90
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:47.180
low as well now let's apply our

91
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.500
situation when if vgs is high as vgs is

92
00:05:51.500 --> 00:06:00.580
high than id is moderate to high

93
00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:08.300
depending on the magnitude of vgs RDS

94
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:14.630
will be very low so low that it will

95
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:21.980
have an exponential effect VDS will be

96
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.190
high

97
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.320
so this is our field effect condition on

98
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.550
what would basically happen now let's

99
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:44.290
look at a graphical standpoint so let me

100
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:49.420
zoom out a little bit try to focus this

101
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:54.580
on more so is let's say that vgs we have

102
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.180
this graph and over time vgs will be

103
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.380
basically increasing and it increases

104
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.800
linearly well you may be wondering will

105
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.230
the drain current increase linearly as

106
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:13.380
well well actually not it will however

107
00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:19.540
be zero in a short period of time in the

108
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.540
beginning so this is how the drain

109
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.410
current would work and look like where

110
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.960
it's essentially zero and up at a

111
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.540
certain point it will increase linearly

112
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:36.780
and then later it will actually Plateau

113
00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.750
for a resistance it's the opposite

114
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.610
effect but it also as I've mentioned

115
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:46.390
will have an exponential decrease so at

116
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.660
this point when the current is slowly

117
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:54.010
going up literally the resistance will

118
00:07:54.010 --> 00:08:01.290
be going down just like that now I've

119
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:04.360
shown you how the drain current would

120
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.450
act late and the voltage between the

121
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.010
drain and the source will have the same

122
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:14.320
effect same graph like vgs now this is

123
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:18.010
what go is is what gets interesting is

124
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:22.930
that what is this line here now this is

125
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.370
a pretty important line boundary and

126
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:31.120
this boundary is basically the region

127
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:36.810
between the cutoff and the linear mode

128
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:41.139
this is the cutoff we are essentially

129
00:08:41.139 --> 00:08:45.310
voltage there is some voltage between

130
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.829
the gate and the source but then it's a

131
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:50.050
cutoff because the circuit is open and

132
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.930
there is no current flowing through the

133
00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:56.850
drink drain to the source at all and

134
00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.660
also the resistance is very very high

135
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.059
but when there is current that is able

136
00:09:04.059 --> 00:09:08.110
to go through that point is called this

137
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.939
is a pretty important thing to point out

138
00:09:09.939 --> 00:09:14.110
this is the voltage threshold where once

139
00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:16.930
that a voltage between the gate and the

140
00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.639
source passes through the value of the

141
00:09:18.639 --> 00:09:21.399
threshold voltage current will be

142
00:09:21.399 --> 00:09:25.170
flowing through a now the last thing I

143
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:27.550
want to just first write this down this

144
00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:30.120
is the linear mode now the linear mode

145
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:34.660
doesn't go through this graph because

146
00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.610
there is another mode that I haven't

147
00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.680
mentioned and that is called the

148
00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:42.399
saturation mode right here and the

149
00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:44.379
border between the saturation and the

150
00:09:44.379 --> 00:09:46.209
linear mode is when the current

151
00:09:46.209 --> 00:09:48.579
saturates and plateaus as you can see

152
00:09:48.579 --> 00:09:57.519
I've drawn here so at this point even

153
00:09:57.519 --> 00:09:59.259
though when the voltage between the gate

154
00:09:59.259 --> 00:10:01.839
and the source is increasing it will

155
00:10:01.839 --> 00:10:03.550
come a certain point where the drain

156
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:06.069
current cannot increase anymore and that

157
00:10:06.069 --> 00:10:08.019
is good because we don't want the MOSFET

158
00:10:08.019 --> 00:10:13.750
to overheat so how do we apply this

159
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.579
mathematically understanding the three

160
00:10:15.579 --> 00:10:18.069
modes the cutoff where the current is

161
00:10:18.069 --> 00:10:21.069
not flowing at all we know where the

162
00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:23.559
current is steadily increasing depending

163
00:10:23.559 --> 00:10:26.769
on the rate of change of the voltage

164
00:10:26.769 --> 00:10:28.600
between the gate and the source and the

165
00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.019
saturation mode when the current is not

166
00:10:32.019 --> 00:10:37.050
changing at all well very simple and

167
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:40.980
that is where the operating mode

168
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:45.850
conditions are explained so if the

169
00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:47.649
voltage gate source is below the

170
00:10:47.649 --> 00:10:50.089
threshold that will be the cut

171
00:10:50.089 --> 00:10:56.240
mode when the voltage drain source is

172
00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.720
less than the difference between vgs

173
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.300
minus the threshold voltage that will be

174
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:08.120
the linear mode and when the voltage

175
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.089
drain source is now greater than this

176
00:11:11.089 --> 00:11:13.790
this difference then it will be in

177
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:19.519
saturation mode so there you have it the

178
00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:22.819
most simplest way to explain what a

179
00:11:22.819 --> 00:11:26.180
MOSFET is and the MOSFET as I've

180
00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:27.730
explained is the

181
00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:29.889
metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect

182
00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:37.449
transistor and it is something that is

183
00:11:37.449 --> 00:11:41.420
able to amplify or switch electronic

184
00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.629
signals that is caused by a voltage

185
00:11:43.629 --> 00:11:47.269
source also known as the voltage gate

186
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:49.999
source hope you guys enjoyed this video
