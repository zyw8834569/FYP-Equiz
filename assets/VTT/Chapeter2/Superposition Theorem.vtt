00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.949
in this lecture we are going to have

2
00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.100
discussion on superposition theorem we

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.930
will see what is superposition theorem

4
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.840
and how to use this theorem to do the

5
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.059
analysis of linear bi-directional

6
00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.020
networks and we will start with the

7
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.150
statement of superposition theorem

8
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.710
superposition theorem states that the

9
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.590
voltage across all the current through

10
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.800
an element in a linear circuit is the

11
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.149
algebraic sum it is the algebraic sum of

12
00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.450
the voltages across all the currents

13
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.719
through that element due to each

14
00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.850
independent source acting alone

15
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.309
this statement will make complete sense

16
00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.789
after solving one example now from this

17
00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.420
statement we can say that in a linear

18
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.250
bi-directional network containing more

19
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.520
than one independent source the response

20
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.340
in any element is the sum of responses

21
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.219
obtained with one source acting at a

22
00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.290
time and the other source is being

23
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.830
turned off now what do we mean by turned

24
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.340
off turned off means all the independent

25
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.150
sources are replaced by their internal

26
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.580
resistances that is we replace every

27
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.759
voltage source by zero volt or we can

28
00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.400
say the short-circuit and every current

29
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.830
source by zero ampere or we can say that

30
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.650
open circuit for example here we have

31
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.640
this voltage source and if we want to

32
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.950
turn off this voltage source then we

33
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.360
will simply short-circuit this voltage

34
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.950
source here we have short circuited in

35
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.290
this voltage source and if we have the

36
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.180
current source and we want to turn it

37
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.829
off then we will open circuit this

38
00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.750
current source here we have open

39
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.060
circuited this current source so this is

40
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.610
what do we mean by turning of the

41
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.520
independent sources now before we move

42
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.590
on to the example to understand the

43
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.169
superposition theorem in a better way we

44
00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.810
will first note down two important

45
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.530
points

46
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.260
according to the first point we do not

47
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.380
turn off the dependent sources the

48
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.160
dependent sources are left as they are

49
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.520
this is important point to remember in

50
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.860
second point we should note down that

51
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.650
the superposition theorem is not valid

52
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.730
in case of non linear circuits so this

53
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.710
is all for the introduction now we will

54
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.020
move on to the implementation and I have

55
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.780
taken one question to understand how we

56
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.510
can use superposition to find the

57
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.870
voltage across an element so here is our

58
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.990
network and we need to find this voltage

59
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.830
V by using the superposition theorem I

60
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.500
will give you few seconds to analyze the

61
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.160
given Network

62
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.920
I hope you are done now we will move on

63
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.920
to the solution when you observe the

64
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.160
given network you will find we have 1 &

65
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.460
2 sources and we have two resistors out

66
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.800
of which we need to find the voltage

67
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.770
across 4 ohm resistor and for this

68
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.540
purpose we will use superposition

69
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.120
theorem and according to the

70
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.700
superposition theorem the voltage across

71
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.820
an element is the algebraic sum of the

72
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.210
voltages due to each independent source

73
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.580
acting alone we have two independent

74
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.460
sources and we need to find out voltage

75
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.460
across this resistor due to each source

76
00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.280
one by one and then finally we will add

77
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.410
the obtained voltages to have the net

78
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.750
voltage V this will be more clear once

79
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.540
we start solving the question so what I

80
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.580
will do first is I will consider the

81
00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.280
voltage across 4 ohm resistor due to

82
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.550
this source so first I will consider

83
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:11.690
this 6 volt source and this means we

84
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.060
need to turn off this 3 ampere source

85
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.850
that means we will open circuit the

86
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.450
source so let us copy in the given

87
00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.290
Network and after copying it we will do

88
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.440
some modifications and the modification

89
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.150
is we will open circuit this source and

90
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.100
we will write V as V sub 1 because this

91
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.920
is not the voltage V we have turned off

92
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.110
this source and therefore the voltage

93
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.420
obtained here is only due to this source

94
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.020
now it is very easy to find out V 1 if

95
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.600
we can find out the current through this

96
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.080
resistor we can have V 1 and to find out

97
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.280
the current in this loop we will first

98
00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.940
assume the current to be i1 and then we

99
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.940
will apply KVL after applying the KVL we

100
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.820
will have plus 6 volts minus i1

101
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.600
multiplied to 8 minus i1 multiplied to 4

102
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.200
equal to 0 so we will have I 1

103
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.470
equal to 6 divided by 8 plus 4 or we can

104
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.650
say that current high 1 is equal to 0.5

105
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.190
amperes now V 1 it is equal to I 1

106
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.300
multiplied to 4 we know Ivan it is 0.5

107
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.990
therefore V 1 is equal to 0.5 multiplied

108
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.770
to 4 and that is 2 volts so in this way

109
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.040
we have obtained V 1 which is voltage

110
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.340
across 4 ohm resistor due to 6 volt

111
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.310
source alone now we will find out the

112
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.560
voltage across 4 ohm resistor due to

113
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.100
this source so this time we will

114
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:04.040
consider the 3 amperes source and this

115
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.440
means we need to turn off the 6 volt

116
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.930
source so again we will do the

117
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.170
modification in our network and this

118
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.960
time we are going to short-circuit the 6

119
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.620
volt source so I will remove this source

120
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.180
and then we will have a short circuit

121
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.690
plus I will change the name of V we will

122
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.990
call it V sub 2 now again we will focus

123
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.880
on the calculation of voltage across

124
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.970
this resistor but this time we will find

125
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.850
it out due to this source here when this

126
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.600
source is turned off and to find out the

127
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.840
voltage v2 we will first find out the

128
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.230
current in this branch let's say the

129
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.580
current is i2 and once we have I - we

130
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.620
can have v2 to find out I 2 we will use

131
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.990
the current divider rule according to

132
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.820
the current divider rule we will have i2

133
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.660
equal to the total current entering

134
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.060
multiplied to the other resistance which

135
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.930
is 8 ohms divided by the sum of 2

136
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.400
resistances 8 plus 4 so we have I 2

137
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:23.440
equal to 3 multiplied to 8 divided by 12

138
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.440
so in this way we have obtained I 2

139
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.090
equal to 2 amperes

140
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.320
now we can find out V 2 V 2 is equal to

141
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:39.590
I 2 which is 2 multiplied to 4 ohms so

142
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.800
finally we are getting V 2 equal to 8

143
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:48.139
volts so 8 volts is the voltage across 4

144
00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:50.419
ohm resistor because of this 3 ampere

145
00:07:50.419 --> 00:07:53.720
source now the net voltage across this

146
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.340
resistor which is V is equal to V 1 plus

147
00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:03.800
V 2 and this is from superposition

148
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.190
theorem we know V 1 we know V 2 we will

149
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:11.330
have V equal to 2 plus 8 that is 10

150
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:15.590
volts so 10 volts is the answer

151
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:15.770
