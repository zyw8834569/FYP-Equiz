00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.429
in this video we're gonna talk about how

2
00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.190
to use 7-inch theorem to calculate the

3
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.830
current that is flowing through the load

4
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.980
resistor RL so what we need to do is we

5
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.690
need to determine the Thevenin

6
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.050
resistance and the Thevenin voltage once

7
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.119
we do that we could simplify the circuit

8
00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.660
like this here is the load of resistor

9
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.779
this is the Thevenin resistance and this

10
00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.510
is the Thevenin voltage and in this form

11
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.430
it will be relatively easy to calculate

12
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.110
the current flowing through the load

13
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.620
resistor so let's find a Thevenin

14
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.239
resistance first so we need to do is

15
00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.280
redraw the circuit we're going to be

16
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.289
placed the independent voltage source

17
00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.480
with a short circuit the independent

18
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.010
current source will be replaced with an

19
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.559
open circuit so we're not gonna draw

20
00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.890
anything there and we're gonna draw what

21
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.860
is left over from point A to point B so

22
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.850
we're going to take out the load

23
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.250
resistor what we need to do is calculate

24
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.369
the equivalent resistance of the circuit

25
00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:22.229
from point a and point B now notice that

26
00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.350
the 4 ohm resistor is in parallel to the

27
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.400
5 ohm resistor so the equivalent

28
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.200
resistance of those two resistors will

29
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.770
be 1 over 4 plus 1 over 5 raised to the

30
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.970
minus 1 now these two resistors are in

31
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.439
series with the 9 ohm resistor so we can

32
00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.540
add 9 if you want to you can redraw the

33
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.090
circuit like this this can help you to

34
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.479
see it better

35
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.240
so this is point a and this is point B

36
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.369
so here's the 9 ohm resistor this is the

37
00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.070
4 and this one's the 5 so now you can

38
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.570
see that these two are parallel to each

39
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:09.679
other but in series with the 9 so the

40
00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:19.370
Thevenin resistance is going to be you

41
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.000
should get 11 point 2 repeating so

42
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.580
that's the Thevenin resistance our next

43
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.840
step is to calculate the Thevenin

44
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.610
voltage so what I'm going to do now is

45
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.980
get rid of the load resistor because

46
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.840
what we need here is an open circuit to

47
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.280
calculate the Thevenin voltage you need

48
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.049
to have everything except a load

49
00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.430
resistor so what we need to do is

50
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.489
calculate the voltage potential between

51
00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.640
points a and B now we're going to assign

52
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.470
this potential zero volts so that's

53
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.470
going to be the potential at point B

54
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.880
let's call this new point Point C now

55
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.500
because we have an open circuit here

56
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.650
after we remove the load resistor

57
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.239
there's no current flowing through the

58
00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.670
night ohm resistor if there's no current

59
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.650
flowing through it there is no voltage

60
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.930
drop across the nine ohm resistor which

61
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.019
means that VC is equivalent to VA and

62
00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.989
since VB is zero the Thevenin voltage

63
00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.200
will be equal to VA so if we could find

64
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.750
VC then in this example that's going to

65
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.560
equal the feminine voltage so we're

66
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.630
going to use nodal analysis to get the

67
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.709
job done so let's focus on Point C and

68
00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.139
the currents that are entering and

69
00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.480
leaving Point C so let's call this

70
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.630
current one it's going into point C so

71
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.799
that's going to be a positive current

72
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.019
we'll call this current - that's flowing

73
00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.510
into the junction and then I 3 is

74
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.790
leaving the job

75
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.379
so according to kirchoff's current law

76
00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:12.260
the sum of the currents flowing in and

77
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.120
out of a junction is going to add up to

78
00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.079
one so we have positive I 1 plus I 2

79
00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.980
minus I 3 and that's going to equal zero

80
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.560
now we know that the current is equal to

81
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.050
the voltage divided by the resistance

82
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.840
based on Ohm's law so to calculate I 1

83
00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.139
the voltage across this resistor is

84
00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.500
going to be 50 volts minus the potential

85
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.410
at Point C divided by the 4 ohm resistor

86
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.950
I to is based on a current source of 3

87
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.210
amps I 3 now there's no current flowing

88
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.720
through the nyam resistor so I 3 is

89
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.150
flowing completely through the 5 volt

90
00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.400
resistor so I 3 is going to be the

91
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.639
potential at C minus the potential at B

92
00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.660
which is zero divided by the 5 one

93
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.669
resistor because I three all of it flows

94
00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:18.110
through the five ohm resistor so now we

95
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.169
have this we need to calculate or solve

96
00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.430
for VC let's multiply both sides by 20

97
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.500
so we're gonna have 20 divided by 4

98
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.080
which is 5 and that's gonna be

99
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.979
multiplied by 50 minus VC and then 20

100
00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:39.169
times 3 is 60 and then 20 divided by 5

101
00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.810
is 4 times what we see here so that's

102
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.310
going to be negative 4 VC now let's

103
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.300
distribute 5 250 minus VC so 5 times 50

104
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.880
is 250 minus 5 VC plus 60 minus 4 VC

105
00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.400
which equals 0

106
00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.570
250 plus 60 that's V 10 negative 5 plus

107
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.120
negative 4 is negative 9 BC but if we

108
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.080
move it to the other side

109
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.610
it's going to be positive 9 BC dividing

110
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.700
both sides by 9 we get VC which equals

111
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.190
the Thevenin voltage and that's going to

112
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.180
be

113
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:24.980
three 10/9 which is 34.4 repeating so

114
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.480
that's the Thevenin voltage for this

115
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.580
problem so now we can draw the

116
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:40.180
simplified circuit which looks like this

117
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.620
so we have a Thevenin voltage of thirty

118
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.490
four point four we have a Thevenin

119
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.340
resistance of eleven point two and a

120
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.480
load resistance of six ohms which was

121
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.060
what I wrote down before so now we can

122
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.920
calculate the current flowing through

123
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.790
the load resistance so that current is

124
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.730
going to be the voltage divided by these

125
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.820
two resistors in series the voltage is

126
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.450
thirty four point four repeating and the

127
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.160
resistance is going to be eleven point

128
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.580
two repeating plus six so that's thirty

129
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.150
four point four repeating over seventeen

130
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.030
point two repeating which gives us a

131
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.090
current of two amps so that is the

132
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.140
current flowing through the load

133
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.320
resistor now we can confirm the answer

134
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.990
body solve them for everything in the

135
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.980
circuit so here is the circuit that I

136
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.190
redrew and we said that the current

137
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.050
flowing through the six ohm resistor is

138
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:50.420
two amps so if this is the ground

139
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.100
potential at zero volts two times six

140
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.640
will give us a potential at Point a

141
00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:02.510
which will be 12 volts and we said this

142
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:06.320
is Point C now we still have two amps of

143
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.390
current flowing through the nine ohm

144
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:12.740
resistor so 9 times 2 is 18 add an 18 a

145
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.580
12 gives us a potential of 30 volts at

146
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:22.880
Point C now 30 divided by 5 is 6 so we

147
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.580
have a current of 6 amps flowing through

148
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.530
the 5 ohm resistor

149
00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:31.800
now let's think about this so we got two

150
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:36.150
amps flowing in this direction six go in

151
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.460
here that means that there must be eight

152
00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.039
currents I mean not a currents but eight

153
00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:43.530
amps of current that is flowing in that

154
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:45.900
direction now we have a current source

155
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.120
of three amps flowing in this direction

156
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:53.850
so 8 minus 3 is 5 which indicates that 5

157
00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:56.430
amps of current is flowing through the 4

158
00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:01.470
ohm resistor now 5 times 4 is 20 so we

159
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.510
have a voltage drop of 20 and that's a

160
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.720
30 that gives us the potential of 50 at

161
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.870
this point so we could see that

162
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.450
everything makes sense everything adds

163
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:15.590
up all the currents and the voltages

164
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:19.170
they follow you know KVL and the KCl

165
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:24.320
laws so that's it for this problem
