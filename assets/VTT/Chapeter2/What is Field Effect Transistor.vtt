00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.620
in this easy eight video lecture we will

2
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.710
learn about field effect transistors

3
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.829
types of Fe T construction working and

4
00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:11.950
the characteristics of J FET

5
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.089
construction working and the

6
00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:16.610
characteristics of MOSFET and the

7
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.890
application of the MOSFET as a switch

8
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.470
field effect transistor abbreviated as

9
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.140
fut is a unipolar device meaning that

10
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.779
current conduction takes place only due

11
00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.020
to one type of carrier this is the major

12
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.840
difference between the BJT and the FE T

13
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.059
as the BJT conduction of current takes

14
00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:38.680
place due to the both electrons and

15
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.400
holes

16
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.100
the advantages of fe t and BJT are high

17
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.219
input impedance Fe T is a voltage

18
00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.890
control device it provides high degree

19
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.379
of isolation between the input and the

20
00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.420
output less noisy etc

21
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.200
f it is our mainly of two types Junction

22
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.519
field effect transistor or J FET and

23
00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.290
metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect

24
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.259
transistor or MOSFET

25
00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.520
Junction field effect transistor was

26
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.909
first described by Shockley in 1952 J

27
00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.009
FET is a 4 terminal device with the

28
00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.560
terminal names as gate drain and source

29
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.080
the four terminal called as the body

30
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.880
terminal is always connected to the

31
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.429
source there are two types of gfitz as

32
00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.570
an n-channel jfet and a p-channel jf8

33
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.280
thus we represent only three terminals

34
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.650
in a symbol of Japheth

35
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.820
let's start with the construction of

36
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.790
n-channel jfet the name n-channel

37
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.369
signifies that here electrons are the

38
00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.330
majority charge carriers to form the

39
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.390
n-channel jfet we take n-type

40
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.520
semiconductor as the base and drop it

41
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.799
with a p-type semiconductor at both the

42
00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:03.280
ends

43
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.920
both these P regions are electrically

44
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.440
connected to each other and an ohmic

45
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.360
contact is taken out of which is called

46
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.630
as the gate two more terminals are taken

47
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.569
out from n substrate and are called as

48
00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.720
source and the drain the surge a FET has

49
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.519
three terminals source and drain and

50
00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.380
gate similar to BJT jf8 also has two PN

51
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.190
junctions

52
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.190
for constructing a p-channel jf8 we take

53
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.080
a piece of straight and dope n-type

54
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.180
semiconductors at the two ends to form

55
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.440
the gate thus the two types of gfitz are

56
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.610
constructed as shown

57
00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.190
hey it's time to concentrate now moving

58
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.870
forward towards the working net spies

59
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.060
the J effete with the two voltage

60
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.670
sources one between the gate and the

61
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.400
source as vgs and the second between the

62
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.790
drain and the source as VDS the source

63
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.090
acts as a common terminal initially as

64
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.430
no voltage is applied the depletion

65
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.440
region is formed across the two PN

66
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.540
junctions

67
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.760
being of n-type the drain-to-source

68
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.459
channel contains electrons as majority

69
00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.030
charge carriers application of the small

70
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.069
drain to source voltage makes these

71
00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.110
electrons flow from the source to the

72
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.510
drain as the positive voltage at the

73
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.330
drain attracts them thus the drain

74
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.310
current flows through the Jay FET from

75
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.299
the drain to the source now let's keep

76
00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.120
the VDS constant and apply some gate to

77
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.310
the source voltage

78
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.310
P region contains holes applying the

79
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.230
negative voltage to the gate makes the

80
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.770
PN Junction reverse biased the depletion

81
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.500
region width increases and it penetrates

82
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.140
more deeply into the channel decreasing

83
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.760
the channel width and thus the drain

84
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.140
current reduces

85
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.420
now if we increase the gate voltage

86
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.910
towards a more negative side the

87
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.950
depletion region goes on increasing and

88
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.320
a point comes when the channel gets

89
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.010
depleted completely the value of vgs is

90
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.440
called as the pinch of voltage or

91
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.020
threshold voltage at this point the

92
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.649
current flows stop now let's keep the

93
00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.870
vgs voltage constant written between

94
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.270
zero volts and the pinch off value and

95
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.440
increase the VDS voltage VDS is nothing

96
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.240
but the voltage drop across the channel

97
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.550
which increases as we move towards the

98
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.030
drain also the reverse bias voltage of

99
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.050
VG s is the highest at the drain

100
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.880
thus the depletion region gets a tapered

101
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.520
shape near the drain and channel becomes

102
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.850
much narrower in this case thus I D

103
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.920
remains constant and the characteristic

104
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.480
graph becomes nonlinear

105
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.810
now studying all the cases you may have

106
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.660
a question that why vgs is never

107
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.200
positive gate voltage primary controls

108
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.140
the flow of the drain current if we

109
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.050
apply vgs positive this will make the PN

110
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.450
Junction forward biased and the gate

111
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.440
sees this to control the current flow

112
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.600
thus we never apply a voltage above zero

113
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.050
volts to the gate terminal the synergy

114
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.510
FET the output current ID is controlled

115
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.230
by the input voltage vgs thus fe t is a

116
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.690
voltage control device whereas BJT is a

117
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.830
current control device

118
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.810
the characteristics of japheth are as

119
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.180
shown in the figure

120
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.980
the metal-oxide-semiconductor

121
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.280
field-effect transistor or simply mosfet

122
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.460
is the cousin of jfn as the boat exhibit

123
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.420
the same nature of F ETS MOSFET is also

124
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.640
divided in two types such as enhancement

125
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.810
and depletion type

126
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.580
seriously pay attention this is

127
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.070
important

128
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.050
MOSFET has also four terminals as gate

129
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.800
drain source and body but the body

130
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.720
terminal is always connected to the

131
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.440
source so the MOSFET is considered as a

132
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.240
three terminal device

133
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.460
so let's see the construction of the

134
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.910
mosfet now to construct an n-channel

135
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.419
MOSFET p-type semiconductor structure is

136
00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.870
considered as the base or substrate then

137
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.660
we dope to n-type wells to obtain the

138
00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.610
source and the drain terminals which

139
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.440
form the required end channel between

140
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.620
the two thus we get the MOSFET structure

141
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.009
as shown

142
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.440
the symbols of Jeff ed and MOSFET are

143
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.510
almost the same except that there is a

144
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.610
dotted line between gate and the other

145
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.550
two terminals in MOSFET this is because

146
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.310
in the MOSFET the gate terminal is kept

147
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.560
isolated from the drain and the source

148
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.350
with the help of an oxide layer and the

149
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.000
metal is used to make the contact

150
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.190
terminal

151
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.990
thus this device is named as the metal

152
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.670
oxide semiconductor field effect

153
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.600
transistor

154
00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.130
moving forward let's start with the

155
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.490
working of MOSFET let's consider that

156
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:20.259
vgs and VDS is equal to zero volts the

157
00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:22.120
mosfet remains stable but depletion

158
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.520
region is formed due to PN Junction as

159
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.020
shown now let's apply the positive vgs

160
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.740
as shown as the positive voltage is

161
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.740
applied to the gate terminal holes near

162
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.509
the gate are repelled towards the

163
00:07:37.509 --> 00:07:40.720
substrate hence mosfet operates in the

164
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.289
cutoff mode

165
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.440
when we increase the gate voltage about

166
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.560
a threshold value all holes get depleted

167
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.930
from the depletion region and the gate

168
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.850
attracts all the minority charge

169
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.330
carriers this forms the inversion layer

170
00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.400
near the gate which contains only

171
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.670
electrons this layer acts as a channel

172
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.520
and as it contains only electrons it is

173
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.040
called as the end channel as this

174
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.320
channel enhances due to increase in the

175
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.960
gate voltage this Fe T is called

176
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.130
enhancement type MOSFET

177
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.750
now let's apply a positive voltage to

178
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:23.320
the drain which is n-type when we apply

179
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.380
positive potential to the drain the

180
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.840
depletion region near the drain widens

181
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.110
due to reverse biased PN Junction

182
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.899
as we increase the strain voltage above

183
00:08:34.899 --> 00:08:37.089
the gate voltage applied electrons from

184
00:08:37.089 --> 00:08:38.799
the channel field a strong force of

185
00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:40.839
attraction towards the drain and start

186
00:08:40.839 --> 00:08:42.279
flowing from the source to the drain

187
00:08:42.279 --> 00:08:45.519
through the channel this motion

188
00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:46.959
generates the drain current which flows

189
00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:50.920
from the drain to the source increasing

190
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.899
the VDS further we reach a point where

191
00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:55.269
this channel width starts to decrease at

192
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:57.850
the drain terminal and the channel gets

193
00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:00.459
tapered and is transformed into a single

194
00:09:00.459 --> 00:09:04.870
point after this point even if we

195
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:08.339
increase the VDS ID remains constant

196
00:09:08.339 --> 00:09:11.410
after this point MOSFET goes into a

197
00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.250
saturation mode

198
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.850
thus we can summarize the working of the

199
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:19.480
MOSFET in the following table

200
00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.950
when it is in the cutoff mode or

201
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.680
saturation mode it acts as a switch and

202
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.350
when it is in the active region it acts

203
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:29.950
as an amplifier

204
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.589
thus we observe the following

205
00:09:32.589 --> 00:09:34.029
characteristics for the enhancement

206
00:09:34.029 --> 00:09:36.330
MOSFET

207
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.290
now let's focus on the applications of

208
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:44.250
the MOSFET same as the BJT MOSFET can

209
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:49.140
also be used as a switch now this

210
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.240
operation of the MOSFET solely depends

211
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.450
upon the vgs voltage provided voltage

212
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.550
VDS between the drain and the source is

213
00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.030
positive ends mosfet is called as

214
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.810
voltage controlled current source

215
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:06.510
when vgs is equal to zero no channel is

216
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:06.990
formed

217
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.600
thus mosfet acts as an open switch and

218
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.980
the bulb remains off and when vgs is

219
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.140
increased above the threshold voltage a

220
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.270
channel is formed between the drain and

221
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.220
the source and the flow of the current

222
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.300
starts thus mosfet acts as a closed

223
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.620
switch and the bulb glows

224
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.890
let us now review what we've learned in

225
00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.410
this video lecture field effect

226
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.080
transistors are of two types J fads and

227
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.620
MOSFETs the G FET are further divided

228
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.450
into n channel J fat and p channel g fat

229
00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.790
whereas the MOSFETs are the enhancement

230
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:50.510
type and the depletion type for n

231
00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:53.210
channel J fed to P regions are doped

232
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:56.480
into the N substrate as shown the gate

233
00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.490
is taken out from the P region and the

234
00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:00.800
source and the drain are taken out from

235
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:05.030
the n substrate for P channel jf8 the

236
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.730
base is of p-type and the end regions

237
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.580
are doped along its two sides the gate

238
00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.040
is taken out from n-type base and the

239
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.870
source and the drain terminals are taken

240
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:19.310
out from the P regions applications of

241
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:21.260
the positive VD a starts the current

242
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:25.430
flow keeping VG s constant increase in

243
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.930
the VDS increases the drain current ID

244
00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.310
linearly and then the Contra means

245
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:32.960
constant

246
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.810
keeping the VDS positive and constant

247
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:38.820
application of the negative vgs reduces

248
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.700
the channel width the channel becomes

249
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.010
narrow and at pinch off point the

250
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:48.000
current flow stops for constructing an N

251
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.930
channel MOSFET - n wells are doped onto

252
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:55.140
the p-type substrate or base the gate

253
00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.500
terminal is taken out from p-type the

254
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.360
source and the drain are taken from n

255
00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.580
Wells and the body terminal is connected

256
00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:06.270
to the source the gate is isolated from

257
00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:10.850
the body by using sio2 oxide layer

258
00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:12.900
application of the positive gate voltage

259
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.410
vgs repels the holes from the p-type and

260
00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:18.450
attracts the minority electrons from the

261
00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:22.170
base these electrons form a channel as

262
00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:26.190
shown a VDS voltage greater than VG's

263
00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:28.770
voltage when applied attracts the

264
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.540
electrons and constitutes the drain

265
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.780
current

266
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.610
further increase in the VDS leads the

267
00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:38.530
pinch of point where the current ceases

268
00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.610
to flow

269
00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:44.070
MOSFET is used as a switch when operated

270
00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.980
in the cutoff region it acts as an open

271
00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:50.700
switch when operated in saturation it

272
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.280
acts as a closed switch and in the

273
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:57.200
active region it acts as an amplifier
