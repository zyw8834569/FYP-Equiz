00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.180
hello everybody so today's video we will

2
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.540
be talking about CMOS so a CMOS

3
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.670
basically is a well it stands for

4
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:33.289
complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor

5
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.079
so it's like a logical transistor that

6
00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:54.320
is used to perform logical functions and

7
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.500
the CMOS is essentially divided into two

8
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.479
main parts and these two main parts are

9
00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.830
simply two types of MOSFET transistors

10
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.460
so the first one here is a PMO's

11
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.630
the MA stands for MOSFET and the P

12
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.430
essentially stands for whole

13
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.920
concentrated and that whole is basically

14
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.090
this hole right here and the basic

15
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.479
function of this P Mo's transistor is

16
00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.390
that whenever you input something it's

17
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.619
going to give us the opposite result so

18
00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.220
in simple terms what we have is input

19
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.420
with a low and a high and that low and

20
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.569
the high get represent binary numbers so

21
00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:56.119
low represents zero and the high

22
00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.560
represents one and for this P moss when

23
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.810
we input something low it's going to

24
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.759
give us the opposite result which is

25
00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:12.260
high respectively if we have an input

26
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.690
that is high then the output is going to

27
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:22.579
be low and that's how it goes for ap

28
00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.340
Mo's and that's our first MOSFET

29
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.850
transistor that covers half of our CMOS

30
00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.980
the other half is called an N Mo's

31
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.030
and the N Moss is basically just the

32
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.000
opposite of what a P Moss is and then an

33
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.459
Moss is electron concentrated so it

34
00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.019
doesn't have that hole and the following

35
00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.769
results when we input something glow

36
00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.280
we're going to get the same value so if

37
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.239
we have the input which is low the

38
00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.340
output is given that our output is going

39
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.590
to be high if our input is high and our

40
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.959
output is going to be high as well well

41
00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.840
sorry my pad if our input is low sorry

42
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.849
if the input is low then the output is

43
00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.180
going to be low as well therefore if the

44
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.130
input is high the output is going to

45
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.610
give us high because for an N Mo's

46
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.180
transistor we're going to get the value

47
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.760
of our output whatever our input value

48
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.120
is so I'm sorry if I label this first as

49
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:45.280
high and that's it for what a CMOS is

50
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.370
and if we combined our P Moss and our n

51
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.139
MOS together this is how it's going to

52
00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:58.010
look like so this right here would be

53
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:05.709
our p MOS and here would be our n loss

54
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.120
and in simple terms if we combine these

55
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.660
two together and we have our voltage

56
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.880
source connected to the source of our P

57
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.430
Mo's and the ground connected to our

58
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.000
drain of the or source of the N Mo's

59
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.200
we're going to have an inverter and the

60
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.360
basic fundamental device of a CMOS is an

61
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.810
inverter

62
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:52.190
and also Appy Moss is part of the n-type

63
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.780
substrate and the N Moss is part of the

64
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:06.570
p-type substrate in addition if you want

65
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.930
to clarify and state that this is a

66
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.370
number well let's test out our input so

67
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.949
let's say that what we do know about an

68
00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:20.340
inverter is that whenever we have when

69
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.110
we input something is going to give us

70
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.800
the opposite effect so for P moss and n

71
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.060
Moss together if we stick them together

72
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.479
and we have if they share the same input

73
00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.370
this is going to what's going to be like

74
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.550
so let's say that we have an input and

75
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:43.770
we set it as low once it's low the P

76
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.520
Moss is going to give us the output as

77
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.830
high so when it's high the transistor is

78
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.139
closed the transistor is turned on and

79
00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:58.530
the voltage traveled across the P MOS

80
00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.190
transistor to the output for the n MOS

81
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:08.220
the input is a low then the n MOS the

82
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.699
transistor for that is going to be open

83
00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:12.960
it's turned off so it's going to be

84
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.389
opened so the ground does not travel to

85
00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:17.430
the output therefore the output is going

86
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.789
to give us high or the magnitude of what

87
00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:28.039
the voltage is now if the input is high

88
00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:31.440
P Moss will be turned off because it

89
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.479
gives us the opposite effect and then

90
00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:35.849
the N Moss is going to be turned on so

91
00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:39.389
it will be closed in the ground the

92
00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:40.919
magnitude of the voltage in the ground

93
00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:43.380
which is a zero will travel to the

94
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.650
output so the output is going to be low

95
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.800
and I'm just going to draw the output

96
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.719
table for this

97
00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:56.580
just so you guys would be able to recap

98
00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.519
with what I just said the last minute

99
00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:04.499
and a half so our input right here zero

100
00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:10.589
and one and our output will be 1 and 0

101
00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:15.719
and this right here is what a inverter

102
00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:21.959
is and this inverter is basically formed

103
00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:26.069
by having a P mas and n must form

104
00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:29.309
together and this thing creates what our

105
00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:33.649
CMOS is so that's how CMOS operates I

106
00:07:33.649 --> 00:07:35.969
hope you guys enjoyed this video and

107
00:07:35.969 --> 00:07:38.999
I'll see you in the near future so you

108
00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:41.459
guys checked out my CMOS video now I

109
00:07:41.459 --> 00:07:43.139
highly recommend you guys to check out

110
00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:45.809
the box below which is a practical

111
00:07:45.809 --> 00:07:51.439
example on where we use CMOS to design a

112
00:07:51.439 --> 00:07:54.439
function
