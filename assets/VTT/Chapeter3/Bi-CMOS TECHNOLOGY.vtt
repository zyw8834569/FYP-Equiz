1
00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.649
hi everyone and this is Suren Kumar from

2
00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.050
EC Department baby senior in college or

3
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.990
a level so today we are discuss about

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.320
the concept of bi CMOS technology in the

5
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.609
stream of VLSI circuit into the today's

6
00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.519
context what we discussed today bliss

7
00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.090
tis so introduction abstract so

8
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.150
characteristics of CMOS technology so

9
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.480
characteristics of bipolar technology so

10
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.700
combined advantages in bi CMOS

11
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.309
technology so bi CMOS fabrication

12
00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.140
process and bi CMOS integrated circuits

13
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.039
advantages or bi CMOS transistors and

14
00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.250
disadvantages of bi CMOS transistors and

15
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.110
applications of bi CMOS transistors in

16
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.050
comparison between CMOS and bi CMOS and

17
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.210
bi CMOS products in the list of

18
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.789
different bi CMOS products and finally

19
00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.750
conclusion so coming to the introduction

20
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.610
and the history of semiconductor devices

21
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.909
so started in the early years of 1930s

22
00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.240
so bipolar technology was started in the

23
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.869
year 1980s and similarly the CMOS

24
00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.240
technology was also started in the mid

25
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.290
of 1980s so Lateran so 1990s

26
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.869
there was a cross war between so bipolar

27
00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.770
technology as well as so CMOS technology

28
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.040
in bi CMOS technology so both so Maus

29
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.920
and bipolar devices or fabricated and

30
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.560
it's same chip that means so previously

31
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.500
how so bipolar transistors visit is like

32
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.500
and similarly so MOS transistors like n

33
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.509
MOS transistor P Mo's transistor as well

34
00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.149
as C Mo's transistor each one having its

35
00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.210
own features now has to be go with the

36
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.670
combined features of bipolar transistor

37
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.920
as well as C Mo's transistor there

38
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.990
should be available in bi C Mo's

39
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.329
transistor technology when we can

40
00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.670
combine so MOS transistors as well as

41
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.419
bipolar transistors coming to the the

42
00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.360
object to of this bipolar CMOS

43
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.590
transistor is

44
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.620
combined so bipolar I and so CMOS

45
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.530
transistor so as we exploit the

46
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.959
advantages of both the technologies in

47
00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.190
the same transistor so today my CMOS has

48
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.530
become one of the most dominant

49
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.980
technologies used for high speed low

50
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.370
power and high functional VLSI circuits

51
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.849
the process step required for both CMOS

52
00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.739
and bipolars are similar so the bipolar

53
00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.230
CMOS transistor Big Sur process has same

54
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.440
been enhanced and so integrated into the

55
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.030
system was process without any

56
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.400
additional steps that means the same

57
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.769
process is needed for the bi CMOS

58
00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.620
transistor as the same as so CMOS

59
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.299
transistor as well as by Perl

60
00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.200
implementation and the primary approach

61
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.079
to realize high performance bi CMOS

62
00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.810
devices is the addition of so bipolar

63
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.170
process steps to the baseline su CMOS

64
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.069
process the BI CMOS gates and could be

65
00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.889
used as effective way of speeding of the

66
00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.549
VLSI circuits the applications of BI

67
00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.010
CMOS transistors are very wide and vast

68
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.900
applications in many applications were

69
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.500
using bi CMOS transistors nowadays and

70
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.090
all these applications we can discuss in

71
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.370
the latter slides and coming to the

72
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.310
advantages of bipolar and CMOS circuits

73
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.819
can be retained in bi CMOS chips

74
00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.549
that means each bipolar transistor

75
00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.590
having its own advantages and CMOS

76
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.910
transistors also having its own

77
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.400
advantages now it has to be combined the

78
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.109
common advantages as well as the

79
00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.209
individual advantages or bipolar

80
00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.760
transistors in CMOS transistors into the

81
00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.870
BI CMOS transistors and friendly the bi

82
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.630
CMOS technology enables high performance

83
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.090
integrated circuits that is nothing but

84
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.000
Isis but increases the process

85
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.880
complexity okay by using this bi CMOS

86
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.799
technology we are improving the speed

87
00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.738
but the complexity of designing should

88
00:04:16.738 --> 00:04:21.089
be in is also be very more coming to the

89
00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:23.849
what is the abstract of this see most bi

90
00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:26.099
CMOS technology and the BI CMOS

91
00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.270
technology is if

92
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.610
combination of bipolar on CMOS

93
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.099
transistor technologies and CMOS

94
00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.349
technology offers the less power

95
00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:37.319
dissipation smaller noise machines and

96
00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.560
high packing density coming to the point

97
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.990
of view of CMOS technology it offers

98
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.319
only less amount of power and coming to

99
00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.599
the high packing density that means it

100
00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:51.210
by using the CMOS technology we can able

101
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.639
to place very more number of transistors

102
00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.789
in the same IC that is approximately

103
00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.560
around millions of transistors we can

104
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.590
able to place in a single IC and bipolar

105
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.050
technology on the other hand and she's

106
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.440
high switching and I was split input

107
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.900
output speed and good noise performance

108
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.639
that means the speed should be more as

109
00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:13.860
compared to the CMOS technology the pay

110
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.860
paulo technology having speed now we are

111
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.330
in the third generation of BI CMOS

112
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.810
technology coming to the bi CMOS

113
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.389
technology accomplishes both improved

114
00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:27.659
speed for CMOS and lower power

115
00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:30.210
dissipation than the bipolar technology

116
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.729
simply by combining of both so CMOS and

117
00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.520
bipolar technology the main drawback of

118
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.069
bi CMOS technology is the higher cost

119
00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:41.130
due to the adder process complexity that

120
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.259
means individually for the

121
00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:44.909
implementation of bipolar technology has

122
00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:47.069
to use the process of bipolar usually

123
00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:49.259
coming to the CMOS implementation we are

124
00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:51.719
using the fabrication process only for

125
00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:54.690
CMOS only so coming to the combination

126
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.569
of these both by bipolar and CMOS it has

127
00:05:57.569 --> 00:05:59.969
to be used both people are in the

128
00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:01.919
application process as well as CMOS

129
00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:03.599
fabrication process the number of steps

130
00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:05.880
are also be increases then the

131
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.880
complexity is also be more and coming to

132
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.639
the this greater process complexity in

133
00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:15.000
bi CMOS results the cost increase

134
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.159
compared to the conventional CMOS

135
00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:20.190
technology coming to the the

136
00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.590
characteristics of CMOS technology what

137
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.569
are the characteristics we can listed

138
00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:26.669
all the characteristics of CMOS

139
00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:28.830
transistor technology as well as bi CMOS

140
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.990
in the next one and coming to the so

141
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.120
characteristics of CMOS technology

142
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.089
so lower statics power dissipation and

143
00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:40.620
higher noise margin and higher packing

144
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.940
gains

145
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.770
that means we can able to place a

146
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.720
millions of transistors in the single IC

147
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.050
and high-heeled with large integrated

148
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.800
complex functions I am coming to I input

149
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.000
impedance with low dry current coming to

150
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.770
this scalable threshold voltage that

151
00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.990
means very limited threshold voltage

152
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.490
have and high delay load things

153
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.130
sensitivity and low output to drive

154
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.910
current and coming to the low

155
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.130
transconductance an important point is

156
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.700
the bit is a bi-directional capability

157
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.890
so committing the CMOS technology

158
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.720
without drying source and gate coming to

159
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.610
you the source and runs both are

160
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.790
interchangeable we can use in India as a

161
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.560
source as a drain

162
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.520
that's what is a bi-directional

163
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.120
capability a new Idol switching device

164
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.140
and low gain and coming to the

165
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.020
characteristics of bipolar technology it

166
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.270
is higher switching speed as compared to

167
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.940
the CMOS system was having less in speed

168
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.830
switching speed and coming to the

169
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.840
bipolar having higher switching speed

170
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.840
and higher current to drive for unit

171
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.340
area and also be higher gain and

172
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.419
generally is a better noise performance

173
00:07:56.419 --> 00:07:58.550
and better high frequency

174
00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.760
characteristics in bipolar technology

175
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.490
improve I was speed and higher power

176
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.080
dissipation there is a drawback in this

177
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.890
bipolar the Shiva or come in she was

178
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:12.380
lower input impedance and lower packing

179
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.630
density because compared to the CMOS it

180
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.730
has higher packing density in CMOS

181
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.190
coming to bipolar technology it is low

182
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.350
packing density that means it is less

183
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.300
number of transistors you can place in

184
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.600
that and low delay sensitivity to low

185
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.710
and high transconductance the RISM it is

186
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.870
essentially unidirectional that means

187
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.750
you can use only one direction there is

188
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.520
the base terminal ship acts as a base

189
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.250
get in collector terminal ship acts as a

190
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.830
collector only and emitter terminal ship

191
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:44.630
act as an emitter only we are not able

192
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.460
to interchange the terminals but coming

193
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.330
in the CMOS

194
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.339
both the drain and source can be

195
00:08:49.339 --> 00:08:50.990
interchangeable that's whether it's

196
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:51.350
called

197
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:52.940
bi-directional and this is one called

198
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.149
unitary

199
00:08:54.149 --> 00:08:57.120
coming to the the combined advantages in

200
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.050
bi CMOS technology it follows that bi

201
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:03.540
CMOS technology goes somewhere towards

202
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:07.050
combining the services of both CMOS and

203
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.709
bipolar technologies improve speed so

204
00:09:10.709 --> 00:09:13.439
over purely CMOS technology because he

205
00:09:13.439 --> 00:09:16.470
must technology having speed is less

206
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.720
that's where has to be goeth by CMOS

207
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.689
bipolar technology speed and lower power

208
00:09:21.689 --> 00:09:23.459
dissipation than the purely bipolar

209
00:09:23.459 --> 00:09:25.860
bipolar technology required hype power

210
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.350
dissipation here the low power point can

211
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.980
be considered from the CMOS technology

212
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.319
inflexible high go for high performance

213
00:09:34.319 --> 00:09:37.499
and improved current to drive lower CMOS

214
00:09:37.499 --> 00:09:40.410
technology and improved packing density

215
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.079
over bipolar in CMOS technology we have

216
00:09:43.079 --> 00:09:44.639
high packing density thus we can

217
00:09:44.639 --> 00:09:47.220
consider the high packing from CMOS

218
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.959
technology is compared to the bipolar

219
00:09:48.959 --> 00:09:52.439
and high input imprints low output

220
00:09:52.439 --> 00:09:57.110
impedance and high gain and low noise

221
00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:00.660
and this is the the Weisse CMOS

222
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.629
fabrication so that process simply can

223
00:10:03.629 --> 00:10:08.249
absorb and this is the way polar in two

224
00:10:08.249 --> 00:10:09.899
ways that is plain you there is top view

225
00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:14.160
and this is the top view and this is so

226
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.620
cross sectional view and simply we can

227
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.749
observe here in this case we are using

228
00:10:18.749 --> 00:10:21.329
the well process that is you are using

229
00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:26.429
your n value and and this is solutely so

230
00:10:26.429 --> 00:10:28.439
P substrate we are using over here this

231
00:10:28.439 --> 00:10:32.189
is the P substrate and in this case the

232
00:10:32.189 --> 00:10:37.529
well process we are using n substrate so

233
00:10:37.529 --> 00:10:43.110
sorry and this is P substrate and Co and

234
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.899
this is the diffusion we are using here

235
00:10:45.899 --> 00:10:48.720
that is P diffusion for the base contact

236
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:54.179
and this is n diffusion for emitter and

237
00:10:54.179 --> 00:10:57.300
n diffusion for collectors simply you

238
00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:01.170
can observe that is from emitter base

239
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:04.740
and collector n-type p-type and n-type

240
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.899
and diffusion pre diffusion and

241
00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:08.160
diffusion simply resides in

242
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.120
NPN transistors bipolar and simply

243
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.880
observe here in this case so collector

244
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.040
emitter and base this is the

245
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.330
cross-sectional view simply you can

246
00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.180
observe here the base is a P diffusion

247
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.920
emitted is n diffusion and collector is

248
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:26.580
also B n diffusion and this is so P

249
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:31.430
substrate which is used in the end well

250
00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.340
and these are the some models for by

251
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.470
CMOS integrated circuits and these are

252
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:42.030
the simple models and coming to the

253
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:45.510
advantages of by CMOS technology so

254
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:48.960
improved speed over so CMOS CMOS

255
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.420
technology because bipolar transistors

256
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.180
having high in speed more speed compared

257
00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:57.030
to the CMOS improved currently drive so

258
00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:00.570
our CMOS and impose improved so packing

259
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:03.060
density over bipolar transistors and

260
00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.940
lower power consumption than bipolar

261
00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.170
transistors higher input impedance low

262
00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:13.290
output impedance and finally high gain

263
00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:16.410
and low noise machine these are the

264
00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:17.820
advantages and coming to the

265
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.330
disadvantages increased manufacturing

266
00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.130
process complexity the complexity should

267
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.910
be more as compared to the bipolar or

268
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:28.860
CMOS coming to a high cost should be

269
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.380
requires very high cost for the enter

270
00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:34.140
designing or fabrication the speed

271
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.510
degradation due to scaling once you can

272
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.330
scaling down these the speed should be

273
00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:42.360
decreases and longer fabrication cycle

274
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.580
time simply you can observe this is the

275
00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:48.090
so fabrication cycle and initially it

276
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:52.290
has to be goeth so bipolar process after

277
00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:55.290
them it has to be create well after then

278
00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:59.010
gate oxide and poly and finally so CMOS

279
00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.500
process has to be combine all these for

280
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:05.810
the formation of the BI CMOS transistor

281
00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:09.300
so coming to the application solved by C

282
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.230
Mo's transistors okay those are so full

283
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:18.839
custom Isis and co these are so full

284
00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:19.320
custom

285
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.320
Isis and Al automatic logic units and

286
00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.500
barrel shifters and SRAM and DRAM static

287
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.830
Ram as well as DRAM and microprocessors

288
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.890
and microcontrollers and he's also be

289
00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:33.810
used in so semi custom integrated

290
00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:36.660
circuits and some of the very important

291
00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:39.500
applications in resistors flip-flops and

292
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:43.200
standard cells and that has mixers and

293
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.480
analog to digital converters digital to

294
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.960
analog converters and gate arrays and

295
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.080
finally so flash analog-to-digital

296
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.330
converters okay now has to be go with

297
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:58.430
the comparison between so basic CMOS and

298
00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:01.680
bi CMOS transistors in compared to in

299
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:06.360
terms of speed delay and area and see

300
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.360
how as compared to the CMOS by see by

301
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.730
suppose having higher swing speed as

302
00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:15.660
compared to CMOS and coming to the soda

303
00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.940
Lane simply we can observe here for the

304
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.190
same was having high delay by coming to

305
00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:22.860
the bison was having less him delay and

306
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.950
similarly here as compared to area so

307
00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:28.589
CMOS having somewhat higher area

308
00:14:28.589 --> 00:14:32.640
required for by CMOS less area into

309
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.170
these are the three comparisons in terms

310
00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:37.589
of speed delay and area these are the

311
00:14:37.589 --> 00:14:40.620
simple products or divide by design for

312
00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:46.640
by CMOS and finally thank you
