1
00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.799
welcome back to VLSI classes where we

2
00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:05.750
continue with the fabrication process

3
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.099
tuning so in the previous class we

4
00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.290
discussed about en masse and P will

5
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.570
process today we will start with the

6
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.600
n-well process so in P n-ville process

7
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.180
first you will be having a P substrate

8
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.250
wafer you will be having a P substrate

9
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.400
wafer in this P substrate wafer you will

10
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.420
create a Yonville

11
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.600
we will create a en well and in the CN

12
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.230
well you are going to create two sub or

13
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.429
my new tepee wells which form the P Mo's

14
00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:40.550
P plus wells which forms the P Mo's in

15
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.460
his P substrate Hughes created two tiny

16
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.399
anvils to form en masse two tiny an

17
00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.969
anvil to form in Mo's the same steps are

18
00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.370
given only thing is in the previous case

19
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.649
that is using in prevail process you

20
00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.879
were using yun substrate and you created

21
00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.649
P Mo's here you will be using P

22
00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.109
substrate and you'll be creating n Mo's

23
00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:05.059
that's all so you'll be having all the

24
00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.610
diffusion like P plus diffusion n plus

25
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.940
diffusion then contact cuts will be

26
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.610
formed deposition of patterned and over

27
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.950
glass so like this all the steps will be

28
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.670
remains the same look at this the same

29
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.070
thing right so you have P substrate here

30
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.070
and you have formed n plus 1 n plus 1

31
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.280
this is y NC n well formation so it is P

32
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.460
plus P plus this is P mas the first one

33
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.550
is P Mo's then X minus y n Mo's that's

34
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.290
all so this is also the connection of

35
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.380
inverter where this bulk and the source

36
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.700
are interconnected given to be VDD bulk

37
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.300
and source are connected and it is given

38
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.760
to VSS this is for en masse and this is

39
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.280
for weak P Mo's gates are interconnected

40
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.340
given to V in and the drains are

41
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.220
interconnected and given to VSS okay so

42
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.910
if you want me to repeat the circuit

43
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.970
diagram so look at this you have P Mo's

44
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.829
and this is n Mo's this is gate of P

45
00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:13.110
Mo's source of P Mo's drain of P Mo's

46
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.720
Gate of en masse source sorry this is

47
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.620
drain of en masse and source of generous

48
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.200
I'll interconnect these to drain and

49
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.710
drain this is given to VDD and this is

50
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.280
given to VSS Gate are interconnected and

51
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.990
given to V in brain is connected to V

52
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.440
out so V n again look at this gates are

53
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.590
interconnected and given to V in brains

54
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.320
are interconnected given to V out I told

55
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.220
you the bulk will be connected to VSS so

56
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.470
which bulb the bulk will be connected to

57
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.140
source so it is connected to source here

58
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.120
the bulk is connected to source the same

59
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.400
thing you are connecting to source so

60
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.190
this is about yin well process this is

61
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.010
about end well process now there is a

62
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.110
disadvantage in Yonville process there

63
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.140
is a disadvantage in nml process what is

64
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.350
that

65
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.569
structure of envel envelopes s not only

66
00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.120
in Yonville both in PL and yen well

67
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.590
there is a disadvantage

68
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.409
what is that disadvantages so this is

69
00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.140
yen Ville so this is y n type material

70
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.629
this is p-type material and this is

71
00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.910
p-type material and this is y n type

72
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.739
material now look at this there is a

73
00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.049
formation of pnp and npn here you have

74
00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.790
the formation of pnp and npn here PNP is

75
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.629
a BJT transistor NPN is also a BJT

76
00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:46.540
transistor that is these two transistor

77
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.760
will be connected such that they get

78
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.549
latched up that is they won't allow any

79
00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.980
current to flow here they won't allow

80
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.049
any current to flow here they lock the

81
00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.780
system they lock the system they lock

82
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.099
this inverter okay so this locking or

83
00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.879
this phenomena will damage the device or

84
00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.579
it will not allow the allow the device

85
00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.870
to work accordingly so this phenomena is

86
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.228
called twin and sorry larger problem

87
00:04:17.228 --> 00:04:20.139
this is called larger problem to avoid

88
00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:21.639
this larger problem

89
00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.430
to avoid this flash a problem we have

90
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.440
come up with a solution which is called

91
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.610
a twin tub process to in tap process so

92
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.419
what is this twin turret winter process

93
00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.320
sorry so what is this winter process in

94
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.669
winter process you will be having

95
00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.349
epitaxial layer you will be having an

96
00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:46.750
epitaxial layer so what is this

97
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.900
epitaxial layer it is a pure insulating

98
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.830
layer it is an insulating layer it will

99
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.740
not allow any conduction in between and

100
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.220
in this epitaxial layer you will grow an

101
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.270
in well you will grow a PL and in yen

102
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.150
value develop en moss in P well you

103
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.270
develop P Mo's so here sorry n MOS so

104
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.020
here you develop yen Moss here you

105
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.220
develop pima's okay so this is the

106
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.469
epitaxial layer this is the epitaxial

107
00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:22.820
layer in this epitaxially

108
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.400
you will grow pima's and here you will

109
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.490
grow en masse now look at this general

110
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.610
and people are separated by epitaxial

111
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.700
layer which is an insulating layer now

112
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.580
there is no conduction between any of

113
00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.040
these two so both P Mo's and n Mo's are

114
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.640
operated individually they're operated

115
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.620
individually they are not interconnected

116
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.810
with each of them they are not

117
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.390
interconnected with each of them hence

118
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.170
we are free from latch up problem hence

119
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.310
we are free from latch up problem so

120
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.830
this is about CMOS process

121
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.410
the last one is by CMOS technology I

122
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.560
told you what what is bi CMOS technology

123
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.610
so if I combine BJT with N Mo's and P

124
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:20.000
Mo's then we call it as bi CMOS

125
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.970
technology if you have only n Mo's and P

126
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.660
Mo's then it is called CMOS technology

127
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.400
then it is called CMOS technology in

128
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.040
CMOS technology why do we need this bi

129
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.530
CMOS technology already we have CMOS

130
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.710
technology the thing is there are few

131
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.440
advantages in bipolar technology and

132
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.560
there are few disadvantages and

133
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.460
advantages in CMOS technology that is we

134
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.580
have both pros and cons in both the

135
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.980
technology so we are going to combine

136
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.850
them to pick up the advantages whatever

137
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.000
we require say for example look at this

138
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.760
so it has high power dissipation which

139
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.720
is undisciplined Ã¤j-- okay next no

140
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.820
packing density which is a disadvantage

141
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.010
hang again okay

142
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.430
so low input impedance advantage okay

143
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.800
so high output drive current very very

144
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.460
advantage high GM advantage okay

145
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.650
so high frequency at low current

146
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.690
advantage so like this there are

147
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:30.140
advantages and also disadvantages coming

148
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.330
to the limitations so high delay

149
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.360
sensitive load disadvantage

150
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.270
okay so high packing density advantage

151
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:41.689
high noise margin advantage scalable

152
00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:43.789
threshold advantage so there are

153
00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:46.340
advantages here and also disadvantages

154
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:50.090
like low output drive current low GM so

155
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.430
these are all the disadvantages here so

156
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.250
I have to overcome this disadvantage

157
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:58.189
using the bipolar advantages therefore I

158
00:07:58.189 --> 00:08:02.870
design the circuits using CMOS and BJT

159
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.629
which we call it as bi CMOS technology

160
00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:08.659
which we call it as bi CMOS technology

161
00:08:08.659 --> 00:08:11.150
so how do you write this bi CMOS

162
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:19.300
technology behind is bipolar CMOS is

163
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.409
complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor

164
00:08:21.409 --> 00:08:26.389
so bi represents bipolar technology now

165
00:08:26.389 --> 00:08:29.360
this is a structure of BJT so you don't

166
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.250
have different steps here only thing is

167
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:32.870
you have to explain what is this

168
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.779
structure so this is the buried

169
00:08:35.779 --> 00:08:37.610
substrate structure but buried

170
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.860
sub-collector structure okay it is an

171
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:44.149
insulating layer and this is the well of

172
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:47.300
which is Yonville and in this yen value

173
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.880
form P well that is P region which is

174
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.839
base region so it is so in this area you

175
00:08:53.839 --> 00:08:56.029
are adding little more dopant for doping

176
00:08:56.029 --> 00:08:58.130
concentration increasing the doping

177
00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:59.810
concentration so that it is

178
00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:02.329
interconnected with base and you form a

179
00:09:02.329 --> 00:09:05.420
connection here so this is n-type

180
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.459
material this is the n-type material

181
00:09:07.459 --> 00:09:10.279
that forms emitter and this is the

182
00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:12.980
collector because this is y n well you

183
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.230
need n collector here so this is there

184
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.930
also in n-type material and you have

185
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.269
increased the concentration to form the

186
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:23.209
collector now look at this this is

187
00:09:23.209 --> 00:09:26.209
collector which is connected to n

188
00:09:26.209 --> 00:09:28.100
complete well it means it is having the

189
00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.190
largest area and this is the emitter

190
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:33.560
which is having less area and it has

191
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.350
high concentration and this is the base

192
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.810
region this is the base region which is

193
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:41.329
having moderate area here okay

194
00:09:41.329 --> 00:09:43.640
so if you just look it into the top you

195
00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.709
it looks somewhat like this so you will

196
00:09:45.709 --> 00:09:47.620
be having a base connection

197
00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.240
this is the emitter this is the base

198
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.920
connection this is the emitter

199
00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.140
connection and this is the collector

200
00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.330
connection collector is having larger

201
00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.490
area so you have to contact touch here

202
00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:58.480
okay

203
00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.840
so this is about fabrication of bi CMOS

204
00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.020
technology so this is what fabrication

205
00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.890
says about

206
00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:10.520
thank you for watching this video if you

207
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.380
have any doubts you can write me back to

208
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.950
my mail id

209
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.060
