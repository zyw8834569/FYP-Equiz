1
00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.450
hiring on that is getting come on today

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.010
I would like to discuss about the BI

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.059
CMOS fabrication process so as the name

4
00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.820
it says that bi CMOS the complementary

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.430
metal-oxide-semiconductor so binding

6
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.980
that is to our bipolar

7
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.080
we can say that so complementary

8
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.880
metal-oxide-semiconductor music

9
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.820
continues and los angeles team was let

10
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.590
us see and look into the fabrication

11
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.349
process now if you see this capture of

12
00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.559
your bi CMOS it is having one N one and

13
00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.070
one team wants and one NPN BJT that is

14
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.790
bipolar Junction transistor as as you

15
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.059
know the N Mo's application we will are

16
00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.820
here it is very easy for us to

17
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.000
understand about the BI CMOS fabrication

18
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.170
process now let us go or into the matter

19
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.690
where we can see the temperature forces

20
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.809
of the fabrication process of your Y C

21
00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.619
Mon now whenever we want to start a

22
00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.680
fabrication process for that I require a

23
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.840
silicon substrate into which I will be

24
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.939
adding the B type ability to form a

25
00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.000
p-type substrate and on the p-type

26
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.950
substrate I am covering it with an also

27
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.890
to protect the surface on the p-type

28
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.939
substrate to further oxidant now to a

29
00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.549
window is open to an oxide layer by

30
00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.180
using the UV rays and in that window we

31
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.610
are what we are doing here the window

32
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.220
n-type impurities is heavily doped and

33
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.159
we are making a n plus buried layer and

34
00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.780
your P type substrate

35
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.030
why we are making is amanda to

36
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.990
accommodate your BJT transistor now on

37
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.720
the top of your p-type substrate I am

38
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.810
growing and entire surface and going AP

39
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.509
AP text which is used to protect your n

40
00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.070
plus buried layer and as we have seen so

41
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.780
many steps in the end more fabrication

42
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.840
process the same process after placing

43
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.530
the oxide layer I will be placing a mask

44
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.929
to cause the UV rays and will be

45
00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.510
removing this selected areas

46
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.660
by eating process and to form the

47
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.510
windows of the surfaces that I can use I

48
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.599
confirm the transistors in this

49
00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.910
particular place now through the two

50
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.130
windows n-type impurities are diffused

51
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.880
into the ring to form a sort of to form

52
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.850
the NL's so one anvil is for your cream

53
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.489
or the other annually is acting as a

54
00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.800
connector for your bipolar Junction

55
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.069
transistor now again one more window is

56
00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.810
opened here which is used to form your

57
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.720
and most three windows are open towards

58
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.269
the oxide layer in these three windows

59
00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.700
three active devices and most females

60
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.560
and in V&V deity are formed now we are

61
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.799
placing the polysilicon layer and again

62
00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.500
doing the same also of your UV rays and

63
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.430
we are going to unwanted material

64
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.560
finally on the gate of your N Mo's I am

65
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.400
NOT on the gate of your P Mo's we have a

66
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.330
what we see the polysilicon now as we

67
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.250
know character is already foam here and

68
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.799
forming a base but in doing it we type

69
00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.760
substrate enter and will next now I am

70
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.120
diffusing the n-type material cell join

71
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.600
to form an N transistor that is n MOS

72
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.690
transistor and here emitter base and

73
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.810
collector to form a BJT and here I want

74
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.810
a pre diffusion to form a p MOS

75
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.230
transistor and again I am going a layer

76
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.100
of oxide and further doing the window

77
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.190
process so refer the during the UV

78
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.220
resources and the posting the metal

79
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.760
finally forming the N Mo's P Mo's and n

80
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.510
pn BJT transistor which is nothing but

81
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.040
