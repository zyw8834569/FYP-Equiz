44
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.450
by CMOS technology following other

45
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.300
characteristics off by CMOS technology

46
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.349

47
00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.680
technologies in single IC as we know

48
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.370
CMOS has merits over bipolar in areas of

49
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.440
low power dissipation large noise

50
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.580

51
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.849
bipolar has merits over CMOS in areas of

52
00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.239
faster switching speed and large current

53
00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.200
