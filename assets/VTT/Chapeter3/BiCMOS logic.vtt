1
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.350
first lecture from chapter number 8

2
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.900
today we'll solve the last topic from

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.240
chapter number 8 that is by CMOS NAND

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.410
and bi CMOS more we'll start with a

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.110
small recap where we know that CMOS that

6
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.490
a bi CMOS can be in general represented

7
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.830
as a combination of CMOS driver circuit

8
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.329
and two BJT transistors they both are of

9
00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.890
NP and time the output high voltage is

10
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.829
transferred through q1 from space to

11
00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.690
emitter and the output low is

12
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.660
facilitated by this transfer q2 and in

13
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.570
our last lecture we have studied an

14
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.690
example using bi CMOS not then this

15
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.860
lecture philtrum pious CMOS man to and

16
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.240
vice emotion or to write stress for post

17
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.259
study by CMOS NAND 2 we know we studied

18
00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.229
in our last lecture 8:20 that the

19
00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:24.479
formula to that the formula or the

20
00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.340
technique to draw up a CMOS circuit is

21
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.840
this that we draw the regular p MOS

22
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.240
array first this is the regular p MOS

23
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.840
array of an and 2 and then we draw its

24
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.669
regular and most every he'll whereas the

25
00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:47.189
output from the P Mo's is used to drive

26
00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.999
q1 and the output from Elmo's is

27
00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:55.740
connected to the output right and then

28
00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.419
we repeat the same array here the same n

29
00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:07.910
MOS is repeated are being it is repeated

30
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.520
exactly as it is here as it is in

31
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.050
regular CMOS it's repeated here

32
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.950
and then we always have this controlling

33
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.710
transistor which is always an Moss whose

34
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.150
gate is connected to the output from the

35
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.370
P Mo's array and and and it's train is

36
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.460
connected to the queue to transfer it's

37
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.960
always the same and and from the

38
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.290
combination of q1 q2 from the common

39
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.960
terminals of q1 q2 from the meter and

40
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.300
from the collector from the measure of

41
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.280
q1 and from the collector of q2 we get

42
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.180
the output so I repeat the N Mo's the P

43
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.670
Mo's array is drawn as search and most

44
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.610
array is shown here as search as it is

45
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.800
in decoder CMOS the N Mo's array is

46
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.350
repeated once again here we have this

47
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.990
controlling transistors and was input

48
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.510
the gate input hiss from the output of

49
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.840
the most early the train of this

50
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.790
controlling transfer is connected to the

51
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.000
base of q2 and the output from the p MOS

52
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.060
array is connected to the base of q1 and

53
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.209
the output from the n MOS arrays

54
00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.420
connected to the output right we can use

55
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.650
this circuit to to verify the truth

56
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.680
table tt truth table truth table of men

57
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.390
do you know that comes we have this is 0

58
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.680
this is 0 the output should be a pawn we

59
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.470
can verify that and it's actually a

60
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.870
homework for questions if it is 0 0 here

61
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.280
0 here this array will be on and we'll

62
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:06.320
have VDD here VDD here and here we'll

63
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.720
have this base emitter Junction

64
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.160
subtracted out of VDD and the output

65
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.170
will be VDD minus VP II started a

66
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.709
certain video so we output hi would be

67
00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.430
VT minus vbe slightly smaller than VDD

68
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.330
and you can verify it you can verify it

69
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.620
for other options let's move on to the

70
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.800
next

71
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.190
where I have drawn a schematic for bi

72
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.080
CMOS North - so we drop the same policy

73
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.750
the PMO's array is drawn the PMO's array

74
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.970
of regular CMOS is drawn here the N Mo's

75
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.370
array is drawn here the N Mo's array is

76
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.250
repeated here with the same inputs and

77
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.659
this is the controlling transistor like

78
00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:59.490
we always have which is connected to the

79
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.250
output of the P Mo's array and about

80
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.659
output of the fema cell is connected to

81
00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:07.470
the base of q1 and output the drain this

82
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.060
controlling transistor is connected to

83
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.630
the base of the second NPN transistor q2

84
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.900
and the output from the N Mo's array is

85
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.400
connected to the output here is a small

86
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.830
homework for muscles you have to verify

87
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.240
this was table for these four different

88
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.949
options that we can have this - and you

89
00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:37.949
should be ready ready to know should be

90
00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:46.430
able you should be able to draw

91
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:55.639
schematic by CMOS by see more schematic

92
00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:03.270
for any boolean expression this is very

93
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.969
important now after we have studied

94
00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:10.409
everything regarding bi CMOS you should

95
00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:17.840
be able to should be able to draw

96
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.259
schematic for any given boolean

97
00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:25.349
expression people try to solve an

98
00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:28.919
example related to bi CMOS in the next

99
00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:33.029
lecture that will hopefully be our last

100
00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:39.570
lecture our last lecture from Japan her

101
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:40.620
head

102
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.610
thank you
