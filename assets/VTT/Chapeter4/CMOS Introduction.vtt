00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
hey everyone today I want to introduce

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:08.880
the basics of CMOS design so what is

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.190
CMOS CMOS actually stands for

4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.250
complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor

5
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.840
ancestor which just will denote by this

6
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.780
and we'll get an n-type transistor

7
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.770
actually let me go ahead and write

8
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.090
p-type and then we'll get our n-type and

9
00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.610
type II so p-type the way that I always

10
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.910
remember it is P as a circle and that

11
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.399
has a circle and p-type are usually

12
00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.640
going to be connected to a positive half

13
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.830
of the arm of our circuit which I'll

14
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.760
explain a little bit more of that later

15
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.960
so I'm just going to go ahead and write

16
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.659
this up here so VCC and then this will

17
00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.520
be down here to n Moss and then this one

18
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.850
is usually going to be the n-type is

19
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.860
going to be on the lower half of the

20
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.990
CMOS design and we'll say that this is

21
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.610
going to be going up to a P Moss and

22
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.659
it'll be usually connected to ground and

23
00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.659
then this right here I'll call the gate

24
00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.759
on both of them the gate is going to

25
00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.579
tell us whether this um transistor is

26
00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.229
going to be on or off in other words

27
00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.899
whether it's going to let a signal go

28
00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.430
from here down to here or from here up

29
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.770
to here well really it's just letting

30
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.840
the signals pass between this wire you

31
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.189
can think of it almost as a wire between

32
00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.079
and this is just a switch so for p-type

33
00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.509
p-type is going to be on when gate is

34
00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.299
set to zero in other words when we put a

35
00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.389
zero for the input this thing will be

36
00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.919
it'll let a signal pass otherwise if

37
00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.250
it's a 1 nothing will pass um

38
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.760
so the circuit is open so in an n-type

39
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.130
transistor the opposite is true so G is

40
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.320
going to equal to 1 for it to pass a

41
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.080
signal so let's let's do some basic

42
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.670
designs and I'll start with the most um

43
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.730
simplified form of a or the simple most

44
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.100
simple transistor that we can get so and

45
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.560
that is the not gate we already know

46
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.140
that not is like if we have a and then I

47
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.470
have an output then 0 goes to 1 and 1

48
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.560
goes to 0 simple enough so how do we

49
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.140
design our CMOS logic well I'm going to

50
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.910
show you guys a little trick we only

51
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.940
ever on the the C part of this that I

52
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.070
was talking about before means that we

53
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.730
only actually have to look at half of

54
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.860
the circuit or derive half of the

55
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.140
circuit the other half just comes as a

56
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.920
byproduct so in this case I want to

57
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.520
design the negative half so let's let's

58
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.780
see what a is so Y here is equal to not

59
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.890
a ok so let's just look at this knot and

60
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.959
um see the parts here so I'm going to

61
00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.850
circle everything that has a zero in it

62
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.280
and then I'm going to write it connect

63
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.860
that to ground so and we'll do that with

64
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.510
our I'll you guessed it the end Moss

65
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.519
transistor and then I'm going to go

66
00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.370
ahead up here and create a PMO's

67
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.650
transistor since there's really nothing

68
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.780
else that we can do to make this circuit

69
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.930
like more complicated let's just connect

70
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.670
the inputs so here's our a and then this

71
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.420
will be VCC and this will be Y now if

72
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.930
you follow this circuit if a is 1 this

73
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.299
circuit is on so ground comes it pulls

74
00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.610
it up from ground in other words Y

75
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:12.230
becomes 0 y equals 0 if a equals to 1

76
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.390
likewise if I here let me change color

77
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:21.500
real fast if a equals to 0 then this is

78
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.050
pulled down from VCC so y equals to 1

79
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.610
simple enough okay so let's go on to our

80
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.069
next gate let's do a NAND gate there let

81
00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:37.470
me change back my colors so I'm going to

82
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.050
do a NAND gate and this will be a lot

83
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.759
it'll be a lot clearer for showing the

84
00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:45.419
complementary part in this over over

85
00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.610
here we notice that we just have 1 and

86
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.849
moss to 1p moss well we're always going

87
00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:52.319
it for each N moss we're always going to

88
00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:55.710
have 1p moss and the complementary part

89
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.900
basically says if we solve for this half

90
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.060
then this half up here is just going to

91
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.759
be the complement of it of whatever is

92
00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:06.509
down here so what is nand and of course

93
00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:11.900
if we have our a B and then output Y

94
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.710
actually let me go ahead and instead of

95
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.229
writing Y here I'm going to go ahead and

96
00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:21.900
write a B not and so it'll be the NAND

97
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:28.349
so we got 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 okay so for

98
00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.190
NAND gate it's basically not and so we

99
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.050
get a 0 1 1 and 1 so like before let's

100
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.990
go ahead and circle our zeroes I'm just

101
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.880
going to do it in a highlight this time

102
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.800
so we've got our 0 there and how can we

103
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.880
get on this output of 0 well if n Moss

104
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.009
is what's connected to our ground then

105
00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:54.659
let's just link these two things

106
00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:56.819
together serially so that's what we'll

107
00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:59.759
do I'll have one transistor second

108
00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:03.810
transistor and then ground so this will

109
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.279
be our it doesn't really matter what

110
00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:06.840
order I'll just put a B there

111
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.569
I'll put an A here and then we'll go up

112
00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:10.440
to something

113
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.479
this will be our N Moss circuit up here

114
00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:16.460
and of course we'll have our output a

115
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.120
Barbie but what goes up here well it's

116
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.469
just going to be the complement of

117
00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:24.539
whatever's down here since these two

118
00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:26.969
things are in serial what's up here

119
00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:30.719
should be in parallel so it'll look

120
00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:36.419
something like this let me my sorry for

121
00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:38.250
one sec my tablet is being a little bit

122
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.490
weird

123
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.090
I'll put a B there and then this one is

124
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.480
going to be a and then they just get

125
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.580
both connected to VCC so now let's let's

126
00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.920
go ahead and verify what we did so if a

127
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.700
and B are both 1 this will be true so we

128
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.530
get a path to ground pulling up I'm

129
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.720
going to change colors um erased it no

130
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.170
no no no don't delete that okay

131
00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:21.030
there we go saved it so if a and B are

132
00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.960
both equal to 1 then we have a path up

133
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:30.090
from ground otherwise if a is um if a is

134
00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:33.840
0 or B is 0 we get a path down from VCC

135
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:43.460
so if a equals 0 or B equals 0 then VCC

136
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:50.610
otherwise if a and B then 0 and that's

137
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.260
basically the logic that we've set over

138
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.450
here we notice that if we get any sort

139
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:59.780
of 0 then the output is going to be a 1

140
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:03.180
okay so let's do one more final basic

141
00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:10.710
gate and that is our nor gate so nor of

142
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:17.160
course we have a B and then a or B not 4

143
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:24.870
nor 0 0 or sorry 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 and

144
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.360
then what is the nor anything that is

145
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.550
going to have a 1 here is going to be a

146
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:35.340
0 so 0 0 0 and then 1 it's the opposite

147
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.460
of nor so let's go ahead and create this

148
00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.940
circuit really fast notice how over here

149
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.550
all of these things are 0 the same sort

150
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:47.310
of thing on reason that all of these

151
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.710
things up here are 1 so we can we can

152
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.240
actually derive the circuit in two ways

153
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.010
we could do what we were doing before

154
00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.360
and say let's do the zero half of it or

155
00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.850
since I'm lazy I could just look at this

156
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.060
part and that's what I'm going to do so

157
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.580
since we want on two things that it's

158
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.860
inputs are zero and we get an output of

159
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.190
one well we can just use our P Moss so

160
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:15.990
let's do that we've got our VCC one two

161
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:19.130
just doing them in serial so a and B all

162
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:21.060
technically it's going to be a not and

163
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.080
be not and again order of these two

164
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.690
transistors doesn't really matter a B

165
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:32.670
and then now we have our A or B naught

166
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.310
and we just need to solve for the n Moss

167
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:38.700
on spot well since these two things are

168
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.740
in serial whatever is down here should

169
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.680
be in parallel for its group so we've

170
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.060
got I'm just going to go ahead and draw

171
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.240
a line like that to make it easier oh I

172
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.240
shouldn't have done it that way don't

173
00:09:51.240 --> 00:10:03.260
and done here we go so be B and then a

174
00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.170
man my tablet is not working today

175
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:10.620
sorry about that so now we can just go

176
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.240
ahead and verify again if we get a

177
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.580
single input as a 1 then this is going

178
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.260
to be pulled up from ground otherwise

179
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:20.220
umm if we get both inputs as a 0 as a 0

180
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:25.260
will get pulled down from VCC and that's

181
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.340
really all there is to it

182
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:29.420
every time the point of CMOS design is

183
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.040
that complimentary that is the biggest

184
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:36.600
part of CMOS the C equals complimentary

185
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:43.760
I probably misspelled that ignore it um

186
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.110
yeah it should be an e shouldn't it

187
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:49.170
complimentary oh it doesn't really

188
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.720
matter anyways the complementary means

189
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.790
that whatever's down here its complement

190
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.140
will be up here and whatever is up here

191
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.040
its complement will be down here so um

192
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.990
it should always like when you check

193
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:02.220
your circuits and you want to make sure

194
00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.020
that it's actually a CMOS design you

195
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.580
really only have to check half of it um

196
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.020
like when your transfer

197
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.340
coming from the truth table over to the

198
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.360
circuit to the circuit to the truth

199
00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.640
table you just do half then the other

200
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.590
half should just follow so in this case

201
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.360
I solve for one I could solve for one

202
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.190
because it's easier and then everything

203
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:20.220
else is just going to be zeros okay

204
00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.960
that's really all I wanted to cover for

205
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:26.280
today um I will post another video with

206
00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:29.210
some more examples soon
