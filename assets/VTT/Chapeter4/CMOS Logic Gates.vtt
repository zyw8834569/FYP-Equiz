00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.820
in this video we're going to look at the

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.429
design of basic CMOS logic circuits each

3
00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.320
of our CMOS logic gates will have the

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.799
following complementary structure first

5
00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.929
we have a connection to the positive

6
00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.869
supply voltage called VCC and another

7
00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.750
one to ground then we have our inputs in

8
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.500
this case two inputs a and B a single

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.010
output F a pull-up network that connects

10
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.929
the positive supply voltage to the

11
00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.450
output and a pulldown network that

12
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.270
connects the output to the low supply

13
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.329
voltage or ground the pull-up network

14
00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.210
connects to the supply voltage VCC and

15
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.160
it will be composed of only P Mo's

16
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.550
transistors while the pulldown network

17
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.800
connects to ground and that will be

18
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.770
composed of only n Mo's transistors the

19
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.230
important thing is that only the pull-up

20
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.809
network or the pulldown network can be

21
00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.090
connecting the output to one of the

22
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.250
supply voltages at a time

23
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.989
so either the pull-up network is

24
00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.270
conducting or the pulldown network is

25
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.280
conducting but will never have both

26
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.470
conducting at the same time otherwise

27
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.490
we'd short out our supply voltage the

28
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.570
pull-up network and the pulldown network

29
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.810
as we'll see our logical complements and

30
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.200
again the transistors were using our

31
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.920
CMOS which means complementary

32
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.810
metal-oxide-semiconductor the first CMOS

33
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.210
logic gate which we've already seen is

34
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.600
an inverter the pull-up network consists

35
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.659
of a single p MOS transistor while the

36
00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.090
pulldown network consists of a single n

37
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.740
Mo's transistor if we have a low input

38
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.540
the N Mo's transistor is open and the P

39
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.149
Mo's transistor is like a switch that's

40
00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.549
closed thus there's a conducting path

41
00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.280
through the P Mo's transistor to the

42
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.110
positive supply voltage and the output

43
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.960
is high if we change the input to low

44
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.899
then the N Mo's transistor is like a

45
00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.149
closed switch and there's a conducting

46
00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.660
path between the output and ground

47
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.430
now we'll look at our first two input

48
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.670
CMOS logic gate the pulldown network

49
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.880
consists of two and maus transistors in

50
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.010
series while the pull-up network

51
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.680
consists of two P Mo's transistors in

52
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.820
parallel if both of the inputs are low

53
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.040
then there's a conducting path through

54
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.560
both branches of the pull-up network and

55
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.930
the output is high note that the

56
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.750
pulldown network both switches are open

57
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.200
so there is no connection to ground if I

58
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.640
set one of the inputs to a high I still

59
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.860
have a conducting path in the pull-up

60
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.200
network and there still is no conducting

61
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.020
path to ground in the pulldown same

62
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.760
thing happens if I switch the other

63
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.490
inputs I get a conducting path through

64
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.110
the other branch of the pull-up but

65
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.700
still no conducting path than the

66
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.490
pulldown on the other hand if both

67
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.070
inputs are set high I now have a

68
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.900
conducting path to ground through the

69
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.660
pulldown network but no conducting path

70
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.460
to the positive voltage through the

71
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.150
pull-up network looking at the resulting

72
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.400
truth table we see that this is the

73
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.370
function for a NAND gate not and now

74
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.410
let's take a look at a second example of

75
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.230
a CMOS logic circuit where the pulldown

76
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.220
network consists of two parallel and mas

77
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.620
transistors and the pull-up network

78
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.220
consists of two series CMOS transistors

79
00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.580
in this case if both of the inputs are

80
00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.010
low there's a conducting path between

81
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.150
the output and the and the positive

82
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.760
supply voltage since both of the PMO's

83
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.760
transistors are conducting or closed

84
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.930
switches with low inputs if we change

85
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.630
one of the inputs to a high voltage then

86
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.470
the pull-up network opens up but we do

87
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.570
have a conducting path through the left

88
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.660
branch of the pulldown network between

89
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.269
the output and ground so the output goes

90
00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.680
to low if we switch both of the other

91
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.000
input to be high

92
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.330
we still have a conducting path through

93
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.280
the pulldown network this time through

94
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.410
the right branch but since the bottom

95
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.090
switch is open in the pull-up network

96
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.070
there is no conducting path to the

97
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.490
positive supply voltage now if we set

98
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.340
both of the inputs to high we still have

99
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.710
a conducting path to the through the

100
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.870
pulldown network this time through both

101
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.780
branches and no conducting path through

102
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.810
the pull-up Network if we look at the

103
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.410
resulting truth table this is the logic

104
00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:03.400
for a boolean nor function or not or if

105
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.920
we wanted to design an or gate we could

106
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.650
simply add an inverter to the output of

107
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.330
an or gate note how the output of the

108
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.390
nor gate feeds into the input of the

109
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.000
inverter clicking through each of the

110
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.120
combinations we see that we now get the

111
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:34.970
truth table for a or gate similarly we

112
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.400
can construct an and gate by attaching

113
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.890
an inverter to the output of an and gate

114
00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:51.189
you
