00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:03.199
hello all so today

2
00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:05.520
uh we're going to talk about the

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.200
non-ideal effects

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.240
of mosfet so as you know

5
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.759
as uh with the semiconductor devices

6
00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:15.920
uh the experimental characteristic is

7
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.359
not the same like the

8
00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.480
theoretically uh behavior so

9
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.640
the experimental characteristic is most

10
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.760
facts uh

11
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.199
deviate to some degree uh from

12
00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.199
the ideal relation that have been

13
00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.039
theoretically derived

14
00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.440
using the various assumption and also

15
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.880
approximation

16
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.440
so basically in the character

17
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.440
characteristic for experimental

18
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.600
is a slight difference from the

19
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.960
theoretical one

20
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.760
so this is because of the non-ideal

21
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.480
effects

22
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.600
of mosfets

23
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.360
so here is the outline for this lecture

24
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.600
so i'm going to talk the non-ideal

25
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.280
effect of mosfet

26
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.719
including sub threshold conduction

27
00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.920
channel length modulation

28
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.200
mobility relay variation value

29
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.560
city saturation and ballistic transport

30
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.560
so after that we're going to talk about

31
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.080
the mosfet scaling

32
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.720
so what happened if the gate length or

33
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.560
the channel length of the mosfet

34
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.159
uh shrinking so there are effects

35
00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.200
due to that includes a constant field

36
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.720
scaling threshold voltage first

37
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.040
approximations

38
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.920
generalized scaling and small device

39
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.280
geometries

40
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.720
there are short channel effects

41
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.840
and narrow channel effects

42
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.840
so this is the right figures

43
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.240
shows the iv id vgs

44
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.079
characteristic so the blue lines

45
00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.520
shows the experimental of id

46
00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.600
and the black line is the id for the

47
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.719
ideal case

48
00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.920
for the ideal case is when we apply gate

49
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.880
voltage

50
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.680
until it reaches threshold voltage then

51
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.000
the

52
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.680
current of a drain current start flowing

53
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.599
so this is for the ideal case however

54
00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.680
in actual case or during experimental

55
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.680
before actually it reached the

56
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.480
threshold voltage there is a very small

57
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.280
current

58
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.440
measured for the mosfet and slowly

59
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.160
uh increase until it reaches a threshold

60
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.720
point

61
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.080
and it increase further so

62
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.120
this is for the experimental case so

63
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.959
that's why we call it as a sub threshold

64
00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.840
subthreshold conduction for this case

65
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.980
where

66
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.519
[Music]

67
00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.840
drain current can be measured even

68
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.120
before the threshold voltage

69
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.640
so why is that happen uh because

70
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.360
of the current near threshold voltage so

71
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.440
the last figure here shows the energy

72
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.800
band diagram

73
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.840
of a mos structure with the p-type

74
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.680
substrate bias

75
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.560
okay so for normal behavior so this is

76
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.560
the gate

77
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.519
okay and this is the semiconductor

78
00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.760
so for normal behavior so we apply the

79
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.879
surface potential here uh less

80
00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.400
than the two phi fp

81
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.120
okay in order to make the electrons

82
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.879
flowing from source to drain and current

83
00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:50.319
is flowing so however

84
00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.680
for the condition of

85
00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.360
surface potential in between 5fp

86
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.799
and 25fp there is also

87
00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.920
a current flowing at

88
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.439
drain terminal and this

89
00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:11.920
is we call it as a weak inversion

90
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.200
so that's why there is a slightly

91
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.759
small current of drained drink current

92
00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.160
measured before it reached the threshold

93
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.560
voltage

94
00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:28.080
so that behavior the previous slide can

95
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.840
be explained further

96
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.040
uh in this diagram

97
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.360
okay so this is uh the figure e shows

98
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.240
the

99
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.280
mosfet structure with uh

100
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.280
applying bias so so this is the case

101
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.320
so during accumulation the figure b

102
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.720
so this is the source gate

103
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.520
and the drain so this is what happens so

104
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.040
during accumulation

105
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.320
so the barrier is actually very uh

106
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.199
very large from from zero the applying

107
00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.160
voltage

108
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.919
to uh this two by fb

109
00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.199
so during this uh so electron is a

110
00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.710
very hard to move or to

111
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.720
[Music]

112
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.360
to to to pass the barrier so this is the

113
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.560
electron this is

114
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.600
very hard to pass the barrier

115
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.199
from source to the drain therefore there

116
00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:25.759
is no

117
00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:29.039
current flowing uh from drain to the

118
00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:29.759
source

119
00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.600
however during weak inversion

120
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.560
okay the the barrier is actually uh

121
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.280
lowered

122
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.199
okay so uh from pi fp

123
00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:45.440
to two by fp so now since the barrier is

124
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.199
uh lowered so the electron is uh

125
00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:52.320
can pass through uh from source

126
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.280
this is source gate and drain so

127
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.600
electron can pass through this barrier

128
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.360
and therefore during this weak inversion

129
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.880
drain current can be measured due to the

130
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.000
electron can pass

131
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.479
through uh from source to the dream

132
00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:09.440
therefore elect

133
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.039
uh drain current can be measured

134
00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.479
so this is what happened during

135
00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:17.120
experimental where before it reached the

136
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.400
threshold voltage

137
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.880
there is a slightly current measured so

138
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.720
this is actually due to the weak

139
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.000
inversion so in here we can

140
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.319
summarize that the barrier between n

141
00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:29.199
plus source

142
00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:31.440
and the channel is small therefore

143
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.639
electron can

144
00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:35.280
move to the channel or in other word

145
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.240
electron can

146
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.360
pass the barrier okay so

147
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.800
in inversion so this is source

148
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.720
gate and drain so during inversion

149
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.840
even the barrier become very very small

150
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.680
here okay so it actually electron can

151
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.720
pass through easily okay from source

152
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.440
to the channel and that's why during

153
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.479
inversion

154
00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:04.960
the id can be measured or the ids start

155
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.599
increase so this is what happened during

156
00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:08.560
subtraction

157
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.120
conduction

158
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.160
so this is the summarization of the

159
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.400
threshold current so sub threshold

160
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.360
current uh

161
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.080
id sub is proportional to this portion

162
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.120
and this portion can be simplified

163
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.400
when vds is greater than the fuel

164
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.319
kt so the whole equation

165
00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:37.440
for the id sub can be simplified uh

166
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.840
into this where id sub is proportional

167
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.960
to the exponent

168
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.400
vgs kt so this

169
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.919
uh subtraction id sub is actually

170
00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:51.360
it's a electrical characteristic of a

171
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.479
mosfet

172
00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:59.840
so we call it as a sub threshold swing

173
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.199
so this one can be measured due to the

174
00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:03.840
slope

175
00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.840
of the lock idvg so when we

176
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.360
log scale the uh

177
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.479
the y-axis so we can measure the

178
00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:16.879
slope and we can get the uh

179
00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:18.080
sub-threshold swing

180
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.160
so this subtraction swing is actually a

181
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.280
switching behavior

182
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.280
it's a switching behavior

183
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.560
okay so uh 16 millivolt per decade is

184
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.719
the ideal case which is good

185
00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:35.760
where the device or the mosfet needs 60

186
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.519
millivolt to turn on

187
00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:40.880
uh from off to on or on to off so that

188
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.240
is very ideal case

189
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.159
so this subtraction swing can be

190
00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.640
increased if the leakage current

191
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.800
is very high in the mosfet so

192
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.680
basically this subtraction swing depends

193
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.320
on

194
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.200
different structure due to how much it

195
00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.360
produced the leakage current

196
00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.760
so the higher the leakage current the

197
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.800
sub-tissue swing

198
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.839
will increase more than 60 millivolt per

199
00:09:06.839 --> 00:09:08.880
decade

200
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.600
so the other effect is channel length

201
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.200
modulation

202
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.959
so in ideal case we assume

203
00:09:16.959 --> 00:09:19.120
in the derivation of the iv

204
00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.120
characteristic

205
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.480
the channel link is constant however it

206
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.839
it actually it does not constant so the

207
00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:29.120
left figure

208
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.080
okay so the left figure uh shows the uh

209
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.760
the mosfet structure

210
00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.480
so we have the application of vgs and

211
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.440
vds

212
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.839
so this is the the inversion charge

213
00:09:41.839 --> 00:09:45.120
the blue area so in this case

214
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.600
the transistor channel line is produced

215
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.240
by

216
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.399
l so this l so from source to drain

217
00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:55.440
so basically uh this is the the ideal

218
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.880
case of china line

219
00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.920
so however this channel line is actually

220
00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.000
depends so in how much we apply uh

221
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.760
voltage to the vds so when we apply

222
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.880
uh higher vds so there

223
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.160
there will be uh so this vds so

224
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.680
let's see when we apply vds greater than

225
00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.839
the vds

226
00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:23.360
saturation so actually

227
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.800
uh this mosfet is in

228
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.160
saturation region so the depletion

229
00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.680
region will be extended under the

230
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.040
drain okay under the drain so

231
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.519
this one will be extended therefore

232
00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:41.839
there will be a portion

233
00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:45.279
of the inversion charge to be backward

234
00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:48.560
so this region actually is due

235
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.920
to the high drain

236
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.040
to source voltage that we apply and we

237
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.959
introduce or represent it as a delta l

238
00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:02.160
so this delta if l is depends on how

239
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:02.640
much

240
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.480
high we apply to the vds

241
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.519
so at saturation region a channel will

242
00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:13.200
pinch off at the drain terminal edge and

243
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.480
the pinch off point move towards uh

244
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.680
source as vds is increased

245
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.800
so the right trigger shows what happened

246
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.920
is actually when we apply vds greater

247
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.160
than the vds saturation

248
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.680
so the electron can still uh

249
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.480
flowing so this is the other side is our

250
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.040
sauce

251
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.920
so let's get confused so the the other

252
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.680
side of here is sauce

253
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.399
and gate and this is the dream so

254
00:11:42.399 --> 00:11:44.000
electron can still

255
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.120
flowing through however

256
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.839
it looks like there is a separation at

257
00:11:49.839 --> 00:11:50.399
this

258
00:11:50.399 --> 00:11:53.600
edge to the drain however electron can

259
00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.079
still

260
00:11:54.079 --> 00:11:57.040
pass through this edge where this

261
00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:57.920
electric

262
00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.320
field can actually accelerate the

263
00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.920
electron

264
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.800
to pass through

265
00:12:04.959 --> 00:12:08.480
uh from uh source to drain

266
00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.600
and therefore current can still

267
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.600
be measured at the drain terminal

268
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.519
so this current is actually uh

269
00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:23.279
deviate okay due to the

270
00:12:23.279 --> 00:12:26.320
this delta l so this is what we call as

271
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.600
the channel length

272
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.320
modulation

273
00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.519
so the expression for the delta

274
00:12:35.519 --> 00:12:38.560
l just now represent by this

275
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.240
equation where the delta l depends on

276
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.200
the

277
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.959
uh phi fp and also

278
00:12:46.959 --> 00:12:49.920
the vds saturation that we apply and

279
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.320
also how much different of

280
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.600
the vds so drain current

281
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.279
is proportional to this channel length

282
00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:02.480
so actually uh so the

283
00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.959
drain current is deviate from the

284
00:13:04.959 --> 00:13:07.440
initial due to the

285
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.639
delta l just now so when we have

286
00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:14.160
a delta l portion actually drain current

287
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.360
will increase okay so

288
00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.480
delta l is a function of vds

289
00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.600
so that the id saturation is also depend

290
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:28.240
on the vds and also the delta l

291
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.680
so as mosfet becomes smaller means the

292
00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.800
length become smaller so the effect of

293
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.560
channel line modulation become

294
00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.399
more severe so this is the delta l

295
00:13:40.399 --> 00:13:44.240
become more severe

296
00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.240
okay this is the drain current with

297
00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.560
channel length modulation

298
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.720
the left figure shows the idvd

299
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.839
characteristic

300
00:13:55.839 --> 00:13:59.920
okay for the deviate

301
00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.880
i prime d this is the normal id

302
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.240
characteristic

303
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.360
so for this case we actually have the so

304
00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:07.920
this is

305
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.839
like this so the idbd so anything

306
00:14:11.839 --> 00:14:16.000
that uh greater than this

307
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.079
line is saturation

308
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.959
during saturation region

309
00:14:25.279 --> 00:14:28.000
so when we apply greater vds so this is

310
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.360
happens

311
00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.240
so in this case

312
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.760
uh actually

313
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.800
so for the case of um

314
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.240
normal behavior so this is uh this

315
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.839
id is uh saturate is supposed to be

316
00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:49.040
uh straight line it's a very

317
00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.959
lean normal saturation

318
00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:56.000
however there is a slight slope

319
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.480
okay in experimental the blue line there

320
00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.760
is a slight slope

321
00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.680
so as you can see there is a difference

322
00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.199
between the ideal case

323
00:15:03.199 --> 00:15:06.399
and the experimental so there is

324
00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:09.519
for experimental there is a slight slope

325
00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:12.639
so this slope is actually due to

326
00:15:12.639 --> 00:15:17.040
the due to the

327
00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.680
channel line modulation so there is a

328
00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.800
slope here

329
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.959
so when there is a slope here means

330
00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.160
there is a resistivity so

331
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.199
we need to consider the resistivity uh

332
00:15:31.199 --> 00:15:31.839
during

333
00:15:31.839 --> 00:15:34.720
channel lung modulation so this is their

334
00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.240
id

335
00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:41.839
in saturation so this is id saturation

336
00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.600
so this id saturation is given by this

337
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.639
equation

338
00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:50.560
but when we have a delta l

339
00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.839
channel line modulation so uh we have

340
00:15:53.839 --> 00:15:54.800
this portion

341
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.959
so this portion is actually represent

342
00:15:56.959 --> 00:15:59.360
the china line modulation parameter

343
00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.600
so this portion is actually represent

344
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.360
the output resistance

345
00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.720
so the slope for this one is uh

346
00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.079
voltage over current so we have uh

347
00:16:10.079 --> 00:16:12.560
are not here so they are this r node is

348
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.839
given by

349
00:16:13.839 --> 00:16:16.399
uh if you quantify the equation so given

350
00:16:16.399 --> 00:16:17.519
by this equation

351
00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:20.720
depends on the lambda so when lambda

352
00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.839
uh lambda is actually normally small

353
00:16:23.839 --> 00:16:25.920
so the resistivity or the output

354
00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.120
resistance can

355
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:31.040
be simplified by this equation

356
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.279
that's why we can summarize that

357
00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:38.800
why is the id vds has a

358
00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.360
slightly slow high slope

359
00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.720
compared to the ideal idv idvd

360
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:51.839
is because of the china line modulation

361
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.240
so for the calculation of the channel

362
00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.240
of the current due to the channel line

363
00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.000
modulation you can try

364
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.839
example 11.1 from the textbook

365
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.919
so for the calculation of the channel

366
00:17:11.919 --> 00:17:13.919
of the current due to the channel line

367
00:17:13.919 --> 00:17:15.679
modulation you can try

368
00:17:15.679 --> 00:17:20.720
example 11.1 from the textbook

369
00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:27.599
so next is we move on the mobility

370
00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:30.640
variation so the assumption that has

371
00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.200
been made

372
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.240
in ideal transistor the mobility is

373
00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.960
constant mobility means the electron

374
00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:40.080
uh how uh the electron flow from source

375
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.039
to the drain

376
00:17:41.039 --> 00:17:42.640
so it's actually the mobility of

377
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.880
electron however the mob

378
00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.240
the mobility of electron vary due to the

379
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.039
influence from the gate voltage also

380
00:17:51.039 --> 00:17:52.240
from the decrease of

381
00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.120
effective mobility when the carrier

382
00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:55.840
approach

383
00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.960
validity saturation remain so what is

384
00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.280
this we going to talk in the next

385
00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.679
slide

386
00:18:05.679 --> 00:18:08.720
so what is mobility variation so it

387
00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.960
depends one is depend on the

388
00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.160
how much okay how much uh gate

389
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.760
to source voltage that we apply so the

390
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.799
so when we apply uh gate to source

391
00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:23.520
voltage we will apply vg here so there

392
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.240
will be

393
00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.280
an electric field uh

394
00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:31.120
in a vertical position here

395
00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.240
okay so this positive gate voltage uh

396
00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.280
is applied to form inversion layer so

397
00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.640
the electric field

398
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.840
also in a vertical direction or

399
00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.120
transverse

400
00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:46.960
electric field so due to this

401
00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.000
electric field actually um

402
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.840
so electron is flowing in this direction

403
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:59.280
okay so ideally electron is flowing

404
00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.080
uh very smooth uh from source to the

405
00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.360
drain

406
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.799
okay however when there is a

407
00:19:06.799 --> 00:19:09.600
high electric field uh in the vertical

408
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.559
direction

409
00:19:10.559 --> 00:19:13.919
so it will actually um

410
00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:16.799
give barrier to the electron to flow

411
00:19:16.799 --> 00:19:17.760
very smooth

412
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.640
uh from source to the drain so this

413
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.600
electron in inversion layer

414
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:27.120
actually can move from source to drink

415
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.000
the drain

416
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.520
but need to overcome or to pass through

417
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:31.919
this

418
00:19:31.919 --> 00:19:34.799
electric field so this is the carrier

419
00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:36.160
movement

420
00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.760
to the drain is affected by the

421
00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.200
transverse electric field which we we

422
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.039
explained in the next slide

423
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.240
so this is what happened so for this

424
00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.200
case uh

425
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.400
let's say we have so just now we have

426
00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:58.799
a gate here so we have

427
00:19:58.799 --> 00:20:02.000
gate to source voltage and we apply

428
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.640
high gate voltage when we apply gate

429
00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.559
voltage to the gate so there will be an

430
00:20:06.559 --> 00:20:08.799
electric field

431
00:20:08.799 --> 00:20:11.300
okay so for this case

432
00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:12.799
[Music]

433
00:20:12.799 --> 00:20:14.960
instead of electron flowing from source

434
00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.480
to the drain

435
00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.600
very smooth

436
00:20:19.679 --> 00:20:22.240
however electron need need to pass

437
00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.720
through the transverse electric field

438
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.320
so for this case uh it has

439
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.080
um barrier to overcome

440
00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.640
two so there is electric field

441
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.840
throughout

442
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.360
this uh gate region so electron actually

443
00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.080
instead of

444
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.400
uh going very smooth from source to

445
00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.520
drain

446
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.520
uh so this um actually

447
00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.960
uh the electron pass through in zigzag

448
00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.679
mode so in it pass through one electric

449
00:20:53.679 --> 00:20:54.400
field

450
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.480
and then it go down pass through one

451
00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.440
electric field

452
00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.840
and then it go down so every um

453
00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:04.159
electron uh every mobility of electron

454
00:21:04.159 --> 00:21:04.640
touch

455
00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.760
the this region and this region

456
00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.880
so it actually store charge

457
00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.320
in every uh region it it passed through

458
00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.960
means the barrier it passed through so

459
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.360
it's

460
00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.480
store charged and the current also

461
00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.360
will be depends on the charge that has

462
00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.960
been stored

463
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.840
so for this case uh this effect is

464
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.120
called as a surface

465
00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:32.159
scattering okay so the surface

466
00:21:32.159 --> 00:21:33.840
scattering is actually degrade the

467
00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.520
mobility so why

468
00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.480
degrade the mobility is uh how electron

469
00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.480
flows from source to the drain

470
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.880
so how electron mobile from source to

471
00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.159
the dream

472
00:21:44.159 --> 00:21:46.480
and it has to overcome the electric

473
00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.480
field instead of going straight

474
00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.679
line now it has a zigzag behavior

475
00:21:51.679 --> 00:21:54.799
so this scattering

476
00:21:54.799 --> 00:21:57.679
the if effective transverse electric

477
00:21:57.679 --> 00:21:58.000
field

478
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.200
is given by this equation and this

479
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.799
uh effective mobility is given by

480
00:22:04.799 --> 00:22:08.080
this equation

481
00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.280
so this is what surface scattering so

482
00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.200
surface scattering will degrade the

483
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.799
mobility of electron

484
00:22:14.799 --> 00:22:17.919
thus it will affect the

485
00:22:17.919 --> 00:22:21.600
the current the drain current

486
00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.840
okay the inversion layer mobility so

487
00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.720
this figure shows the electron mobility

488
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.440
versus the electric field in the

489
00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.200
inversion layer

490
00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.480
basically this electric field

491
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.919
or effective electric field is

492
00:22:39.919 --> 00:22:40.799
proportional

493
00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:44.080
to the how much uh gate voltage

494
00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.520
that we apply okay so this uh as

495
00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.919
explained in the previous night uh

496
00:22:49.919 --> 00:22:50.799
effective

497
00:22:50.799 --> 00:22:53.840
uh electric field is due to the lateral

498
00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.080
electric field or transverse electric

499
00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:56.960
field

500
00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.000
so if this uh if

501
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.200
vgs is

502
00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:07.760
higher so this will affect the

503
00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:12.000
electron mobility or the mu

504
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.840
effective will decrease

505
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.280
so this mobility decreases due to

506
00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.320
the electric field so the higher

507
00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.520
the gate voltage the more the electric

508
00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.320
field

509
00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:30.240
lateral vertical electric field produced

510
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.039
therefore the the more difficult for the

511
00:23:33.039 --> 00:23:34.720
electron to pass through

512
00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.840
from source to the drain therefore it

513
00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:38.799
will affect

514
00:23:38.799 --> 00:23:43.200
the amount of drain current

515
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.120
flowing from drain to the source

516
00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:52.400
so to calculate the

517
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.960
effective electric field at threshold

518
00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.159
point

519
00:23:56.159 --> 00:24:01.279
you can try example 11.2

520
00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:06.559
so to calculate the

521
00:24:06.559 --> 00:24:08.960
effective electric field at threshold

522
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.159
point

523
00:24:10.159 --> 00:24:15.279
you can try example 11.2

524
00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.480
okay this figure shows the idvd

525
00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.000
characteristic

526
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.679
uh comparing between when we consider

527
00:24:25.679 --> 00:24:27.279
constant mobility

528
00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:31.120
and also value velocity saturation

529
00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.320
so this comparison of id is

530
00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.080
uh for constant mobility uh

531
00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.440
shows is as in the dotted black line

532
00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:46.799
here okay for velocity saturation

533
00:24:47.039 --> 00:24:50.320
is the blue line okay as we can see

534
00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.240
if we didn't consider the constant

535
00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.360
mobility

536
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.400
then the idbd characteristic is

537
00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.840
normal where it's saturated

538
00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:03.760
saturate and higher

539
00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.279
drain voltage okay for even for

540
00:25:07.279 --> 00:25:10.400
high gate voltage okay but

541
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.520
if we consider the constant mobility as

542
00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.080
we can see

543
00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.120
for smaller vgs

544
00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.400
okay for smaller one volt vgs there is

545
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.640
a very slightly different between the

546
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.919
blue line and the

547
00:25:23.919 --> 00:25:26.559
black line however when we increase

548
00:25:26.559 --> 00:25:27.440
further

549
00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.720
the gate voltage for example this one

550
00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.840
two volt okay there is a deviation okay

551
00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.159
between when we consider velocity

552
00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:36.960
saturation

553
00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.520
and constant mobility so this is

554
00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.120
actually due to the

555
00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.520
electric field that or the surface

556
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.559
scattering that

557
00:25:44.559 --> 00:25:47.679
we explained in the previous previous

558
00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:48.480
slide

559
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.520
so the difference is much greater when

560
00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.480
we increase

561
00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.039
the gate voltage so we can see for the

562
00:25:55.039 --> 00:25:56.000
three volt gate

563
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.799
voltage so this is the line the blue

564
00:25:58.799 --> 00:25:59.760
line

565
00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.559
and this is when we the black line when

566
00:26:02.559 --> 00:26:03.760
we consider

567
00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:07.120
the constant mobility so for this case

568
00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.400
for smaller um

569
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.600
drain current saturation uh the

570
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.559
approximate uh so actually for smaller

571
00:26:16.559 --> 00:26:18.320
drain current saturation

572
00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.039
it does not depends on the gate voltage

573
00:26:21.039 --> 00:26:21.440
but

574
00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.919
for higher drain current saturation it

575
00:26:23.919 --> 00:26:25.600
depends on the

576
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.320
gate voltage when we consider constant

577
00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.039
mobility

578
00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.120
okay the increasing of velocity

579
00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.159
saturation

580
00:26:36.159 --> 00:26:39.200
can actually increase the drain current

581
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.559
thus we will get a faster switching time

582
00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:45.200
where the device or the mosfet can turn

583
00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.000
on and off

584
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.520
in a short time okay so the left figures

585
00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:50.880
shows the

586
00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.520
simple mos structure so this is the

587
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.720
china length from source to the dream

588
00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:00.159
okay represent as the capital l

589
00:27:00.159 --> 00:27:03.440
so there is also a parameter of

590
00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.880
small l so this is actually the distance

591
00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.200
uh between the collision or the

592
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.240
scattering

593
00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.799
what we uh what i have explained in the

594
00:27:12.799 --> 00:27:13.760
previous slide

595
00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.720
so this collision is actually due to the

596
00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.120
uh

597
00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.159
electric field of

598
00:27:20.159 --> 00:27:23.360
the gate to source and drain okay

599
00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:26.320
where it will affect that the electron

600
00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.679
instead of flowing

601
00:27:27.679 --> 00:27:29.520
a straight line from source to the drain

602
00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.840
it has a zigzag behavior if you still

603
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.279
so this is the distance of the electron

604
00:27:37.279 --> 00:27:38.240
to pass through

605
00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.760
from source to drain uh where it has to

606
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.520
overcome the scattering

607
00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:46.880
so in most case cases uh the capital

608
00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:50.080
l is uh greater than the

609
00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:53.120
small l okay so this is

610
00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.399
when scattering uh occurs so for this

611
00:27:56.399 --> 00:27:57.200
case

612
00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.919
uh it is a normal behavior so there is

613
00:27:59.919 --> 00:28:01.919
an electric field

614
00:28:01.919 --> 00:28:04.720
vertical electric field from gate from

615
00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.440
the gate

616
00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.640
therefore the electron has to pass

617
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.799
through from source to drain

618
00:28:10.799 --> 00:28:12.399
to pass through the electric field from

619
00:28:12.399 --> 00:28:15.200
source to 3 in in a zigzag behavior

620
00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:18.399
but what if the l is smaller the

621
00:28:18.399 --> 00:28:21.840
uh the capital l is smaller than the

622
00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.880
small l so this is a very ideal case so

623
00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:28.080
we consider it as a no scattering so no

624
00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.559
scattering effect so the electron can

625
00:28:30.559 --> 00:28:32.240
move very smooth

626
00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.080
uh from source to drain in a straight

627
00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.679
line so this

628
00:28:35.679 --> 00:28:38.559
we call it as a ballistic transport so

629
00:28:38.559 --> 00:28:40.399
ballistic transport it's like

630
00:28:40.399 --> 00:28:42.960
there is no barrier so it can pass

631
00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:43.760
through

632
00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:47.039
in a in in sort of a straight line

633
00:28:47.039 --> 00:28:49.600
so for this case the voltage of valistic

634
00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.360
is greater than the

635
00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.640
voltage of saturation so this actually

636
00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.679
so this behavior so no scattering effect

637
00:28:57.679 --> 00:29:00.240
and ballistic transport can be achieved

638
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.919
by using a novel

639
00:29:01.919 --> 00:29:04.720
morse structure uh we call it as a

640
00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:05.360
carbon

641
00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:08.320
nanotube transistor if you interest to

642
00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.120
know further

643
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.880
you can check out what is carbon

644
00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.640
nanotube so

645
00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.480
the electrons flowing through the

646
00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.919
channel has no

647
00:29:15.919 --> 00:29:19.520
scattering effect and we call it as the

648
00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.360
electron

649
00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:26.480
has a ballistic transport

650
00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.880
this is the summary for ballistics

651
00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.000
transport

652
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.120
in long channel affiti we consider a

653
00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:33.679
drift

654
00:29:33.679 --> 00:29:36.640
transport so this drift transport is

655
00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.840
influenced by the

656
00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.480
scattering effect or collision of the

657
00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.440
electron

658
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.399
or zigzag behavior in the channel for

659
00:29:44.399 --> 00:29:46.399
the electron to pass through from source

660
00:29:46.399 --> 00:29:48.000
to the drain

661
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.559
so the mean distance between scattering

662
00:29:50.559 --> 00:29:52.159
effect or scattering event

663
00:29:52.159 --> 00:29:55.200
is called as a mean path through

664
00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.480
so if the china line gets smaller

665
00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:02.240
so the mean free path or the scattering

666
00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.039
event can be ignored and the carrier is

667
00:30:05.039 --> 00:30:08.080
expected to move in ballistic or without

668
00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:11.279
collision or without scattering so this

669
00:30:11.279 --> 00:30:14.399
carrier velocity is much faster when in

670
00:30:14.399 --> 00:30:14.960
drift

671
00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.520
transport

672
00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:24.559
now we move on the mosfet scaling so

673
00:30:24.559 --> 00:30:25.760
what happened

674
00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:29.120
uh if we scale down the channel line of

675
00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.720
the mosfet

676
00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.640
what happened to the characteristic so

677
00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.120
especially the frequency response of

678
00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:38.399
the fat structure can be improved by

679
00:30:38.399 --> 00:30:40.480
reducing the channel length so what are

680
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.720
the parameters that need to be scaled

681
00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.520
as the channel line is scaled down is

682
00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.200
two parameter

683
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.919
constant field scaling and generalized

684
00:30:49.919 --> 00:30:50.960
scaling

685
00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:55.679
so the constant field scaling

686
00:30:55.679 --> 00:30:58.720
is actually device dimension and the

687
00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.000
device voltage

688
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.840
is scaled such that the electric field

689
00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.360
is remain constant

690
00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.519
doesn't matter it's a vertical electric

691
00:31:07.519 --> 00:31:09.760
field or horizontal electric field

692
00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.799
and we consider the electric field is

693
00:31:12.799 --> 00:31:16.399
constant so for the generalized scaling

694
00:31:16.399 --> 00:31:20.000
is actually um

695
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.159
there are other when we for the apply

696
00:31:22.159 --> 00:31:23.360
voltage

697
00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:26.080
our scale with the skin with the same

698
00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.760
scaling factor

699
00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.399
uh as the divide dimension however in

700
00:31:30.399 --> 00:31:32.640
the actual technology evolution

701
00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:35.919
the voltage does not uh reduce

702
00:31:35.919 --> 00:31:38.960
with the same scaling factor so

703
00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:42.399
this has to look through what are the

704
00:31:42.399 --> 00:31:44.840
effect of the generalized

705
00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:47.840
scaling

706
00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.960
for the first effect which is constant

707
00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:51.679
field

708
00:31:51.679 --> 00:31:55.440
scaling so the constant field scaling

709
00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.039
is a device parameter where we consider

710
00:31:59.039 --> 00:32:01.120
the physical dimension

711
00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.720
the physical dimension means the uh

712
00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:08.159
chandelien the oxide thickness

713
00:32:08.159 --> 00:32:11.919
uh the doping this is all the physical

714
00:32:11.919 --> 00:32:12.960
parameter

715
00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:16.000
and as well as the the width okay

716
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.480
the width

717
00:32:19.279 --> 00:32:23.760
okay the width of the uh device

718
00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:27.519
okay so uh all this parameter is skill

719
00:32:27.519 --> 00:32:30.640
such that the electric field we consider

720
00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.279
constant means the electric field here

721
00:32:33.279 --> 00:32:34.480
is

722
00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.039
constant

723
00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.760
all right so this electric field should

724
00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.600
not be increased to ensure

725
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.559
the reliability of the fact is remain

726
00:32:48.559 --> 00:32:49.679
constant

727
00:32:49.679 --> 00:32:53.200
so but there is one parameter

728
00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.320
introduced which is k parameter

729
00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:59.360
so this is scaling parameter

730
00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.519
so when we consider this scaling

731
00:33:01.519 --> 00:33:02.559
parameter

732
00:33:02.559 --> 00:33:05.600
so all the physical dimension

733
00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:09.039
such as the gate applied voltage

734
00:33:09.039 --> 00:33:12.399
the channel line now become k l

735
00:33:12.399 --> 00:33:14.960
uh the doping concentration now we

736
00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.480
divide by the k

737
00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:22.159
parameter and also the w now become

738
00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:26.720
um kw

739
00:33:26.799 --> 00:33:29.519
all right so all the physical parameter

740
00:33:29.519 --> 00:33:30.399
and now

741
00:33:30.399 --> 00:33:33.200
has to times with the k value which is

742
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:33.679
the

743
00:33:33.679 --> 00:33:36.320
scaling parameter so we notice that the

744
00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.360
channel length

745
00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:40.480
is reduced by 0.7 l

746
00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.120
so basically typical value for k

747
00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.840
scanning parameter is 0.7

748
00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:49.440
therefore uh this parameter uh

749
00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.840
this physical parameter now has to

750
00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:52.640
multiply

751
00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:56.159
by 0.7 but for the doping has to divide

752
00:33:56.159 --> 00:33:56.480
by

753
00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:00.720
0.7 so this scaling parameter will

754
00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.799
affect the drain current

755
00:34:02.799 --> 00:34:04.840
which will be explained in the next

756
00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.840
slide

757
00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:12.159
so when we consider k

758
00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:15.040
scaling parameter or the constant field

759
00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.239
scaling parameter

760
00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:19.520
in the iv characteristic so the iv

761
00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:22.079
the drain current equation will also

762
00:34:22.079 --> 00:34:24.239
depends on the k parameter

763
00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:27.679
so this portion uh is the

764
00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:31.040
id for the original case okay without

765
00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.599
constant field scaling parameter

766
00:34:33.599 --> 00:34:37.359
so this is a quotient is the id scale

767
00:34:37.359 --> 00:34:40.719
where we consider k parameter

768
00:34:40.719 --> 00:34:44.079
okay in the equation where the w times

769
00:34:44.079 --> 00:34:45.199
with k

770
00:34:45.199 --> 00:34:47.440
the channel line times weight k the

771
00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.359
oxide thickness times with k

772
00:34:49.359 --> 00:34:53.520
and also the gate voltage times with k

773
00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:56.800
so for this case uh the new

774
00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:00.640
id skill is depends on the k so if we

775
00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.599
let's say if we take out all the k value

776
00:35:03.599 --> 00:35:04.320
so

777
00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:07.520
the the equation for k will become

778
00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.880
this portion is k times

779
00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:14.960
so this quotient is

780
00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:19.680
k square okay divided by

781
00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:22.880
k times k so

782
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.960
actually if we simplify the equation

783
00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:26.640
we'll get k

784
00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:30.000
so basically uh if we can

785
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.079
uh simplify the equation so id scale

786
00:35:34.079 --> 00:35:37.440
is now uh is equal to the k

787
00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:41.920
times id original before we consider the

788
00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:42.640
k

789
00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.839
parameter scaling

790
00:35:49.599 --> 00:35:52.480
okay for the threshold voltage uh first

791
00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.160
approximation

792
00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.560
this equation is the in the previous

793
00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:57.280
slide

794
00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:00.320
so id scale is depends on the k

795
00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:03.599
scaling parameter all the

796
00:36:03.599 --> 00:36:06.720
physical parameter for w depends on the

797
00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:07.200
k

798
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.920
for l depends on the k for t ox depends

799
00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:10.800
on the k

800
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:14.079
as well as for the vgs it depends on the

801
00:36:14.079 --> 00:36:14.800
skill

802
00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:18.160
factor however for the threshold voltage

803
00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.640
it does not depends on the scale skill

804
00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:21.599
factor

805
00:36:21.599 --> 00:36:25.200
why didn't threshold voltage skill is

806
00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:28.560
because of so from this equation so this

807
00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.280
is

808
00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:33.839
the portion for the doping concentration

809
00:36:38.839 --> 00:36:40.000
okay

810
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.079
right so this portion is actually

811
00:36:44.079 --> 00:36:47.680
proportional to the

812
00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:53.839
square root k so basically uh for this

813
00:36:53.839 --> 00:36:54.480
case

814
00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.839
uh key does not give any uh

815
00:36:57.839 --> 00:37:00.960
much change to the threshold voltage

816
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:04.000
that's why for this case k does not

817
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.680
uh being being scaled okay

818
00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.160
if you want to know more on the summary

819
00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:12.480
of the constant field device scaling you

820
00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.200
can

821
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.240
look at this table 11.1

822
00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:20.079
so each scale parameter is explained

823
00:37:20.079 --> 00:37:23.200
by times k or divide by k or

824
00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:26.079
is actually equal to 1 so you can look

825
00:37:26.079 --> 00:37:27.920
through this scaling factor

826
00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:32.800
in this table 11.1

827
00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.119
generalized scaling there are

828
00:37:37.119 --> 00:37:38.960
shortcomings in constant

829
00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:42.000
field scaling approach

830
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.359
so basically uh it is

831
00:37:45.359 --> 00:37:48.720
uh we consider that the electric field

832
00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:52.160
is constant and the other parameter is

833
00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:53.040
not scale

834
00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:55.119
is threshold voltage and subtraction

835
00:37:55.119 --> 00:37:56.320
current

836
00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:59.119
and electric field cannot be maintained

837
00:37:59.119 --> 00:38:01.200
due to the increase in electric field

838
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.240
decrease

839
00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:05.280
and the device reliability and increase

840
00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.040
in power density

841
00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.280
in generalized scaling not all

842
00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.640
parameters are skilled

843
00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.520
using one scaling factor so the only

844
00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.280
parameters such as

845
00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:18.000
apply voltage and threshold voltage

846
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.040
scale

847
00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.920
more gradually compared to the physical

848
00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.520
dimension which is l

849
00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:27.359
w and oxide thickness

850
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:31.359
okay we will move uh further to the

851
00:38:31.359 --> 00:38:32.480
threshold voltage

852
00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.880
modification so this is one of the

853
00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:35.839
effect

854
00:38:35.839 --> 00:38:39.760
uh non ideal effect uh

855
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.320
this effect is divided into two the

856
00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.599
short channel effect

857
00:38:43.599 --> 00:38:46.000
and narrow channel effect so what are

858
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:46.640
these two

859
00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:50.240
is for it consider

860
00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:54.880
what happened when the gate length

861
00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:57.760
is decreased so there will be a short

862
00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.960
channel effect

863
00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:01.599
and for narrow channel effect is what

864
00:39:01.599 --> 00:39:03.200
happened when the w

865
00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:07.119
decreased so what happened to the

866
00:39:07.119 --> 00:39:09.680
mosfet characteristics so we will look

867
00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:14.079
through after this

868
00:39:14.079 --> 00:39:17.280
now what is a short channel effect

869
00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:20.720
so let us look uh what is short channel

870
00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:21.920
effect from these

871
00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:25.680
uh three figures the first figure shows

872
00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:29.359
at flat band okay where there is no

873
00:39:29.359 --> 00:39:31.920
gate applied voltage and there is no

874
00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.920
space charge region

875
00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.480
or depletion region created underneath

876
00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.040
the

877
00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:40.320
gate okay and

878
00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:43.760
during inversion so this figure

879
00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:47.440
is at inversion okay so this figure

880
00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:51.200
shows at long channel

881
00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.520
sorry

882
00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:57.839
at long channel and the bottom figures

883
00:39:57.839 --> 00:40:11.520
shows at short channel

884
00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:14.640
so at inversion when the gate voltage is

885
00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:17.119
applied

886
00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.640
okay so there will be a space charge

887
00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:21.119
region

888
00:40:21.119 --> 00:40:25.680
created as a shadow area here

889
00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:28.400
so this is a space charge region created

890
00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.160
underneath the gate

891
00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:38.000
all right so this is gate voltage

892
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.200
okay so for this case uh this is long

893
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.720
channel

894
00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:46.640
we we put it as l okay what happened

895
00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:50.640
uh if we scale down the channel length

896
00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:54.319
so now the gate will become smaller so

897
00:40:54.319 --> 00:40:55.280
we have mu

898
00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:58.800
l here we put it as l prime

899
00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:02.160
so this is due to the short channel

900
00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:05.200
so in this case uh the

901
00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.839
space charge region also will become

902
00:41:07.839 --> 00:41:08.720
compact

903
00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:12.160
so as we can see the uh now

904
00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:16.240
the region are compact and um

905
00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:19.040
the area is larger so therefore the

906
00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.000
charge

907
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.200
uh the charge

908
00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:26.079
and the uh shade in the space charge

909
00:41:26.079 --> 00:41:27.839
region here also

910
00:41:27.839 --> 00:41:31.200
will be uh increase the number of charge

911
00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:34.240
so due to this area

912
00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:37.440
change in a short channel

913
00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.000
thus it will also effect the number of

914
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.200
charges

915
00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:44.079
in the space charge region therefore it

916
00:41:44.079 --> 00:41:45.440
will affect the

917
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.079
threshold voltage so how would this

918
00:41:48.079 --> 00:41:49.119
happen

919
00:41:49.119 --> 00:41:53.440
it will be explained in the next slide

920
00:41:55.119 --> 00:41:57.760
so now let's take a look on the

921
00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:00.400
threshold voltage equation

922
00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.960
so this is the equation for the

923
00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.240
threshold voltage

924
00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:07.280
uh the normal case the long channel

925
00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:10.240
okay as we can see it depends on the

926
00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.440
charge

927
00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.839
on the charge at uh the space charge

928
00:42:13.839 --> 00:42:14.880
region

929
00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:19.520
uh q prime sd and the other parameter

930
00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:23.520
so this figure shows the mosfet

931
00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:30.319
structure for short channel

932
00:42:30.319 --> 00:42:33.359
okay and then for this case

933
00:42:33.359 --> 00:42:36.400
um for short channel as i said

934
00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:39.599
uh earlier so the space charge

935
00:42:39.599 --> 00:42:41.839
region under the gate will become more

936
00:42:41.839 --> 00:42:43.040
compact

937
00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:46.800
and will be extended further if we

938
00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:49.520
consider all the space charge region

939
00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:51.440
under the source under the git and under

940
00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:52.079
the drain

941
00:42:52.079 --> 00:42:55.839
so this is source gate and the drain

942
00:42:55.839 --> 00:42:59.200
so it will be uh this term so

943
00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.319
xs will be extended

944
00:43:02.319 --> 00:43:04.960
so this is a space charge region at the

945
00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:05.839
drain

946
00:43:05.839 --> 00:43:08.480
okay and this is the space charge region

947
00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.400
under the gate

948
00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:13.760
so we have that parameter

949
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.720
all right so if we consider the space

950
00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.400
charge region depth

951
00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:21.680
for all uh xs is

952
00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:25.359
equal to the xd xd is equal to x dt

953
00:43:25.359 --> 00:43:28.319
and finally is approximately equal to

954
00:43:28.319 --> 00:43:28.640
the

955
00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:32.240
x dt therefore the charge

956
00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:35.200
per unit area under the gate will become

957
00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:36.800
to this equation

958
00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:40.079
so now the space charge region under the

959
00:43:40.079 --> 00:43:41.280
gate will

960
00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.319
uh if we can see this is

961
00:43:44.319 --> 00:43:47.760
this this portion so this is a

962
00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:51.119
trapezoidal uh

963
00:43:51.119 --> 00:43:54.560
region so if we want to know the

964
00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:57.920
area we need to multiply we need to

965
00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:01.920
sum this uh length and also this length

966
00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.960
and finally it is actually equal to this

967
00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:05.839
value

968
00:44:05.839 --> 00:44:08.960
l plus l prime over two

969
00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:11.839
so therefore the chi the charge

970
00:44:11.839 --> 00:44:12.480
underneath

971
00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:16.480
the gate will be multiplied by this

972
00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:21.200
uh area portion the trapezoidal area

973
00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:24.480
so from the geometry uh actually uh

974
00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:27.280
approximately to equal to this equation

975
00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:28.480
and therefore

976
00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:32.400
the new uh charge underneath the gate

977
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:36.319
will be equal to this equation

978
00:44:36.319 --> 00:44:39.520
so when the charge under

979
00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:43.200
the gate is changed therefore it will

980
00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:46.160
affect the threshold voltage so these

981
00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:46.800
terms

982
00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:50.079
now will the qb will be affected

983
00:44:50.079 --> 00:44:53.599
the the the gate voltage and sorry the

984
00:44:53.599 --> 00:44:55.359
threshold voltage which we

985
00:44:55.359 --> 00:44:59.119
explained in the next slide

986
00:45:00.319 --> 00:45:03.680
if we uh write down the equation

987
00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:06.400
therefore the change in threshold

988
00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.119
voltage

989
00:45:07.119 --> 00:45:10.400
delta vt is equal to the threshold

990
00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:11.440
voltage

991
00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:14.480
of short channel minus the threshold

992
00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:15.040
voltage

993
00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:18.319
of a long channel which given by

994
00:45:18.319 --> 00:45:21.760
this portion of equation and finally

995
00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:25.200
the delta t will be equal to

996
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.400
this long equation

997
00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:32.319
so when if we can uh

998
00:45:32.319 --> 00:45:37.760
summarize it um actually as the

999
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.440
channel link is decreased okay so the

1000
00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:42.800
threshold voltage

1001
00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:46.160
will also be decreased so this is for

1002
00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.640
the case of

1003
00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:51.920
sorry this is for the case of n channel

1004
00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.920
with the end so when the channel line

1005
00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.079
decrease the threshold voltage will be

1006
00:45:56.079 --> 00:45:56.960
shifted

1007
00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:59.920
in negative direction which is towards

1008
00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:00.240
the

1009
00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:03.440
depletion mode

1010
00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:06.960
if you want to try uh how to calculate

1011
00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.800
the threshold voltage shift

1012
00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:11.839
and also the space charge region

1013
00:46:11.839 --> 00:46:15.440
underneath the source drain and the gate

1014
00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:20.079
you can try example 11.3

1015
00:46:21.839 --> 00:46:25.040
if you want to try uh how to calculate

1016
00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.960
the threshold voltage shift

1017
00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:30.000
and also the space charge region

1018
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.599
underneath the source drain and the gate

1019
00:46:33.599 --> 00:46:38.319
you can try example 11.3

1020
00:46:40.079 --> 00:46:42.880
now change in threshold voltage so the

1021
00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:43.839
left figures

1022
00:46:43.839 --> 00:46:47.040
shows the threshold voltage minus uh

1023
00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:50.400
flat van voltage versus uh gate length

1024
00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:53.680
okay as you can see uh the

1025
00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:56.720
the trend are almost the same same for

1026
00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:57.520
all

1027
00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:00.560
uh concentration condition

1028
00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:03.599
this is 10 to the power 11 10 of 16

1029
00:47:03.599 --> 00:47:07.040
and so on so basically the

1030
00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:10.400
trend are almost the same however if we

1031
00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.520
take a look at for the case of short

1032
00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:14.400
channel

1033
00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:19.920
if we take at two micrometer

1034
00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:24.160
okay as we can see if we go

1035
00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:27.440
less than two micrometer so the channel

1036
00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:29.440
line less than two micrometer

1037
00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.359
as you can see the trend start to

1038
00:47:31.359 --> 00:47:33.599
decrease the terrestrial voltage uh

1039
00:47:33.599 --> 00:47:34.319
starts

1040
00:47:34.319 --> 00:47:38.079
uh start to decrease so this happens uh

1041
00:47:38.079 --> 00:47:38.640
as

1042
00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:41.839
due to the uh channel

1043
00:47:41.839 --> 00:47:44.400
lag modulation it's explained in the

1044
00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:45.760
previous slide

1045
00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:48.240
so uh the short channel becomes

1046
00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.599
significant

1047
00:47:49.599 --> 00:47:52.240
when the gate length is less than 2

1048
00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:53.760
micrometer

1049
00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:56.319
and short channel effect is less

1050
00:47:56.319 --> 00:47:57.920
significant

1051
00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:01.520
for low doping substrate

1052
00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:05.440
if we can see at n a equal to 10 power

1053
00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:06.319
of 15

1054
00:48:06.319 --> 00:48:08.880
this is almost straight line and there

1055
00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:09.359
is no

1056
00:48:09.359 --> 00:48:12.880
change in for the case of less than

1057
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:16.559
2 micrometer so if we can

1058
00:48:16.559 --> 00:48:19.119
look for the the same trend the

1059
00:48:19.119 --> 00:48:21.280
threshold voltage versus china line

1060
00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:26.000
so again for the same if we have less

1061
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.920
than two micrometer the

1062
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.119
the threshold voltage is actually

1063
00:48:35.119 --> 00:48:39.119
decreased and this will also become more

1064
00:48:39.119 --> 00:48:40.079
severe

1065
00:48:40.079 --> 00:48:43.280
if we apply larger drain to source

1066
00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.720
voltage

1067
00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:47.760
as we can see for the case of this line

1068
00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:48.240
okay

1069
00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:51.599
the drain voltage is uh at linear region

1070
00:48:51.599 --> 00:48:54.960
where the applied voltage is 0.125

1071
00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:57.040
so there is a change in the threshold

1072
00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:58.319
voltage

1073
00:48:58.319 --> 00:49:01.760
but not very severe but when we

1074
00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.960
apply uh drain voltage uh

1075
00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:08.480
four volt which means this is during

1076
00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:11.359
uh saturation region okay during

1077
00:49:11.359 --> 00:49:13.839
saturation region

1078
00:49:13.839 --> 00:49:15.920
thus the threshold voltage will become

1079
00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:17.359
decreased more

1080
00:49:17.359 --> 00:49:20.720
severe for this case so charge voltage

1081
00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:22.559
does not only

1082
00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:24.880
depends on the gate length it also

1083
00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:25.760
depends

1084
00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:28.400
on the how much bias that we apply in

1085
00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:29.359
the drain

1086
00:49:29.359 --> 00:49:32.319
is either in linear region or saturation

1087
00:49:32.319 --> 00:49:34.640
region

1088
00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:39.680
if we look at the narrow channel effect

1089
00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.079
so

1090
00:49:40.079 --> 00:49:42.319
what is narrow channel effect so what

1091
00:49:42.319 --> 00:49:44.160
happens when we decrease

1092
00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:47.280
the width instead of the length

1093
00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:50.079
this figures uh diagram shows the cross

1094
00:49:50.079 --> 00:49:50.960
section

1095
00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:53.520
along the channel width for n channel

1096
00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:54.559
mosfet

1097
00:49:54.559 --> 00:49:58.319
and this is the w okay

1098
00:49:58.319 --> 00:50:02.079
so if we draw a cross section uh

1099
00:50:02.079 --> 00:50:05.200
for the width so at the back here so

1100
00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:05.520
this

1101
00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:09.359
is the l all right

1102
00:50:09.359 --> 00:50:12.400
so underneath the area i mean the area

1103
00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.520
underneath the gate

1104
00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:17.280
so this area is given by the shaded area

1105
00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:17.920
here

1106
00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:21.359
so this is the area where the charge uh

1107
00:50:21.359 --> 00:50:24.640
trap or stock underneath the gate

1108
00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:28.000
which is given by qb it uh

1109
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.599
equals to the qb naught okay before we

1110
00:50:31.599 --> 00:50:34.640
narrow down the channel line uh plus the

1111
00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:36.240
delta qb

1112
00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:40.640
so qb naught is given by

1113
00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:44.160
this equation e n a w

1114
00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:48.000
l x d t but now

1115
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.359
what happened when we

1116
00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:55.040
decrease the gate gate width okay

1117
00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:58.079
so there will be so this area this area

1118
00:50:58.079 --> 00:51:00.640
is quite straightforward which is

1119
00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:03.440
uh the

1120
00:51:04.079 --> 00:51:06.800
square area but now i'm talking about

1121
00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:07.359
this

1122
00:51:07.359 --> 00:51:09.839
area which is the rate area that i'm

1123
00:51:09.839 --> 00:51:10.480
shaded

1124
00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:13.920
so this area is given by the delta qb

1125
00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:16.640
where it now depends on the fitting

1126
00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:17.760
parameter

1127
00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:21.280
this one okay so this is the fitting

1128
00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:22.160
parameter

1129
00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:24.800
so if we consider this fitting parameter

1130
00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:25.359
now

1131
00:51:25.359 --> 00:51:30.160
the qb will become uh

1132
00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:33.760
will equal to this equation

1133
00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:36.240
so therefore there will be change in the

1134
00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:37.839
threshold voltage

1135
00:51:37.839 --> 00:51:39.839
which is depends on the fitting

1136
00:51:39.839 --> 00:51:40.960
parameter

1137
00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:43.440
times this fitting parameter and delta

1138
00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.119
vt now will become

1139
00:51:45.119 --> 00:51:47.839
with this equation so if we can

1140
00:51:47.839 --> 00:51:49.200
summarize this

1141
00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:52.240
uh we can say that

1142
00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:55.760
as uh w is

1143
00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:58.960
decreased okay then the

1144
00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:02.000
v threshold for the case of the

1145
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.440
n mosfet will be increased

1146
00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:08.160
so additional charge space charge is

1147
00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:09.760
need to be considered for

1148
00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:12.960
narrow channeling

1149
00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:17.599
this is the effect of gate width on the

1150
00:52:17.599 --> 00:52:19.119
threshold voltage

1151
00:52:19.119 --> 00:52:21.680
as we can see this figure shows the

1152
00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:24.000
threshold voltage versus the gate width

1153
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.359
okay as the gate width if let's say

1154
00:52:27.359 --> 00:52:29.920
we take

1155
00:52:31.599 --> 00:52:33.839
8 it

1156
00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:37.920
okay for

1157
00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.960
for the gate width less than the 8

1158
00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.079
micrometer

1159
00:52:42.079 --> 00:52:45.119
the threshold voltage starts to

1160
00:52:45.119 --> 00:52:49.040
increase so instead of the trend

1161
00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:52.079
like this so

1162
00:52:52.079 --> 00:52:55.760
after it reaches a narrower gate width

1163
00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:58.319
so the thruster voltage will start to

1164
00:52:58.319 --> 00:52:59.200
increase

1165
00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:01.359
so threshold voltage begins to become

1166
00:53:01.359 --> 00:53:04.319
apparent or significant for larger

1167
00:53:04.319 --> 00:53:07.599
uh channel width compared to the induced

1168
00:53:07.599 --> 00:53:10.720
space charge width so this trend is

1169
00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:11.760
actually the same

1170
00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:14.960
for uh with the we

1171
00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:17.359
change in the concentration or the

1172
00:53:17.359 --> 00:53:20.400
doping concentration

1173
00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:27.040
therefore this is uh the summarization

1174
00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:29.760
of threshold voltage modification

1175
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.040
threshold voltage change

1176
00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:33.200
due to the channel dimension so the

1177
00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:34.319
figure is

1178
00:53:34.319 --> 00:53:37.280
is the threshold voltage due to the

1179
00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:39.040
channel length

1180
00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:42.079
and figure b shows the threshold voltage

1181
00:53:42.079 --> 00:53:44.640
due to the channel width so at certain

1182
00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:45.359
point

1183
00:53:45.359 --> 00:53:49.359
uh for uh short

1184
00:53:49.359 --> 00:53:51.280
channel length okay the threshold

1185
00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:52.559
voltage uh

1186
00:53:52.559 --> 00:53:54.480
the difference of thruster voltage will

1187
00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:56.880
decrease for this case

1188
00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:59.920
when the l is decreased the

1189
00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:03.359
threshold voltage will be also decreased

1190
00:54:03.359 --> 00:54:05.440
for the case of short channel line for

1191
00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:06.880
the case of

1192
00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:10.480
narrow channeling okay

1193
00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:13.920
uh when we take any of the gate width

1194
00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:17.359
less than uh any certain point

1195
00:54:17.359 --> 00:54:20.720
so if we can summarize this the w

1196
00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:23.920
uh increase but the threshold voltage

1197
00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:25.440
will

1198
00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:29.280
decrease for the china width case

1199
00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:32.480
so that's it for the conclusion for the

1200
00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:33.680
threshold voltage change

1201
00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:36.160
due to the channel dimension for both

1202
00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:36.960
channel length

1203
00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:40.000
and channel with

1204
00:54:41.119 --> 00:54:44.960
so this is the summary of the lecture

1205
00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:48.079
so uh i have explained the sub-threshold

1206
00:54:48.079 --> 00:54:49.200
conduction

1207
00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:52.480
means the id is not equal to zero

1208
00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:55.920
okay so for this case is this uh for the

1209
00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:59.760
experimental uh case uh the real case

1210
00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:02.400
even when the vg s is less than the

1211
00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:03.839
threshold voltage

1212
00:55:03.839 --> 00:55:06.400
in this case uh the transistor is biased

1213
00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:07.040
in weak

1214
00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:09.440
inversion mode okay where the id is

1215
00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:11.760
dominated by the diffusion

1216
00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:15.280
rather than the drift mechanism so the l

1217
00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:17.280
effective or the channel line effective

1218
00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.559
is reduced

1219
00:55:18.559 --> 00:55:22.240
with the vds apply the larger you apply

1220
00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:25.760
vds voltage at drain okay you would

1221
00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:27.440
create an extended region

1222
00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:30.079
under the drain and therefore the

1223
00:55:30.079 --> 00:55:31.040
effective

1224
00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:33.440
gate length will be reduced in this case

1225
00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:34.880
mosfet is biased

1226
00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:37.839
in the saturation region due to the

1227
00:55:37.839 --> 00:55:38.960
depletion region

1228
00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:41.359
and the drain extend into the channel

1229
00:55:41.359 --> 00:55:44.240
this effect is known as a channel

1230
00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:47.280
length modulation

1231
00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:49.440
and the mobility of carrier in the

1232
00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:51.599
inversion layer is not constant

1233
00:55:51.599 --> 00:55:54.319
okay this is because that as vgs is

1234
00:55:54.319 --> 00:55:55.200
increased

1235
00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:57.920
the electric field or the vertical

1236
00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:59.119
electric field or

1237
00:55:59.119 --> 00:56:01.359
transverse electric field under the gate

1238
00:56:01.359 --> 00:56:03.680
okay at the oxide interface will

1239
00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:06.319
increase and this will cause a surface

1240
00:56:06.319 --> 00:56:07.680
scattering effect

1241
00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:10.319
okay due to this scattering effect it

1242
00:56:10.319 --> 00:56:11.119
will lead to

1243
00:56:11.119 --> 00:56:15.280
the mobility reduction and also it will

1244
00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:18.559
deviate the ideal iv characteristic

1245
00:56:18.559 --> 00:56:21.599
okay and as the uh l

1246
00:56:21.599 --> 00:56:24.160
is reduced the lateral electric field is

1247
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:26.240
increased so that the caries flowing

1248
00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:27.599
through the channel

1249
00:56:27.599 --> 00:56:30.319
may reach their saturation velocity in

1250
00:56:30.319 --> 00:56:31.119
this case

1251
00:56:31.119 --> 00:56:34.160
the drain current become a linear

1252
00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:36.559
function

1253
00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:39.359
and then finally if i could summarize

1254
00:56:39.359 --> 00:56:42.000
that the tendency of mosfet

1255
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.559
design becomes smaller so the gate

1256
00:56:44.559 --> 00:56:45.760
length or the l

1257
00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:48.640
become smaller so the principle of

1258
00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:49.599
constant

1259
00:56:49.599 --> 00:56:52.559
field scaling has been discussed okay so

1260
00:56:52.559 --> 00:56:54.880
the modification in threshold voltage as

1261
00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:56.960
device dimensions shrinking

1262
00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:59.920
not only the l the w as well the the

1263
00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:00.799
gate width

1264
00:57:00.799 --> 00:57:03.119
has been discussed so because of the

1265
00:57:03.119 --> 00:57:04.880
charge sharing effect

1266
00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:06.880
in the substrate the threshold voltage

1267
00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:07.920
decreased as

1268
00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:10.720
the gate length decreased and also the

1269
00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:12.160
threshold voltage increase

1270
00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:19.040
as the width at the gate width decrease
