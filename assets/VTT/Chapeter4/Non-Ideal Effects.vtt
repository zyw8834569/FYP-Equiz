00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.759
[Music]

2
00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.160
okay so let's talk a little bit about

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.120
some other non-ideal effects in a pn uh

4
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.320
junction

5
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.320
so we'll start out with a junction

6
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.599
recombination

7
00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.920
and start deriving some expressions that

8
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.199
hopefully make sense to you

9
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.599
so here we are let's take a

10
00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.880
p-n junction under bias as

11
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.679
sketched here and we write down again

12
00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.280
the

13
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.800
mass action in non-equilibrium

14
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.480
we had written this down before this is

15
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.480
just a reminder that means

16
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.760
the product of n and p in this

17
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.840
non-equilibrium condition

18
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.800
is no longer just ni squared but it's

19
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.280
proportional to the exponent

20
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.399
of the applied voltage

21
00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.840
which translates into the difference

22
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.440
between two quasi-fermi

23
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.600
levels for an electron quasi thermal

24
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.879
level and the

25
00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.960
whole quasi-fermi level all right so

26
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.200
that being said we can use this

27
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.240
expression

28
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.400
for a little bit of work just as a

29
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.320
reminder what's the recombination

30
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.360
process

31
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.600
so you started with an electron and a

32
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.479
hole

33
00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.360
and they recombine and destroy each

34
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.000
other

35
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.600
we've gone through that at quite some

36
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.799
detail and you remember this pretty

37
00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.720
horrendous looking expression for the

38
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.119
shockley reed hall

39
00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.920
equation that describes the

40
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.880
recombination via traps

41
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.119
and in order to get the trap current or

42
00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:42.720
the recombination current

43
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.240
we integrate the total amount of decay

44
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.000
of these electrons

45
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.280
uh via the shockley read hall expression

46
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.520
and we integrate

47
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.119
the decay over the depletion region here

48
00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.399
okay so let's make a couple of

49
00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.719
assumptions to make our life easier

50
00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.240
let's assume for simplicity's sake that

51
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.640
the

52
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.440
minority carrier lifetimes are identical

53
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.000
and that we deal with

54
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.360
traps that are at mid gap

55
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.080
or at the intrinsic level here that

56
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.440
means

57
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.319
that n on n1 p1 or ni

58
00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.160
so that makes this expression we have up

59
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.599
here um

60
00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.840
more palatable uh we basically plug in

61
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.239
n times p here and we find the ni

62
00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.519
squared

63
00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.040
and the exponential minus 1.

64
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.680
we are

65
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.440
setting the taus to be identical and

66
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.480
then we have a

67
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.599
the tau over here and an x plus p x

68
00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.200
plus 2 ni all right so that's a

69
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.319
more palatable expression and

70
00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.040
again what this indicates is that

71
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.159
there's a recombination

72
00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.239
in the depletion region that is

73
00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.840
significant

74
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.280
as you crank up a voltage

75
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.599
okay because you're creating a

76
00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:14.959
significant charge

77
00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.000
imbalance from the equilibrium values so

78
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.760
there shall be given that there are

79
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.200
traps and

80
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.959
a finite relaxation time

81
00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.599
tau that brings in the traps there shall

82
00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.080
be some sort of relaxation

83
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.319
now if the minority carrier lifetime

84
00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.640
were

85
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.799
infinity tau towards infinity

86
00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.360
right no relaxation that means this

87
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.720
relaxation term would be

88
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.000
zero so if we didn't have traps

89
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.760
then tau would be infinity then delta n

90
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.840
dt would be zero the recombination would

91
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.959
be zero

92
00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.360
okay

93
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.680
all right now as before

94
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.280
you can write down the um

95
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.439
intrinsic energy level in the system

96
00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.840
as part of the equilibrium on the left

97
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.120
and

98
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.799
add the apply an

99
00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.399
applied electrostatic field

100
00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:22.000
to it like this and you can then

101
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.080
plug this expression of ei

102
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.600
into the expression for n

103
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.040
over here and calculate an electron

104
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.280
density throughout the device

105
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.040
now in the majority carrier region

106
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.120
so in the end orb region n

107
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.320
is approximately nd right it's a doping

108
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.560
so it's flat

109
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.199
and as this distance here

110
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.120
between

111
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.080
the fermi level

112
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:11.840
and the intrinsic level sorry

113
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.320
you have a decaying exponentially

114
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.320
decaying number of electrons in the

115
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.800
system

116
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.120
so you end up with a curve like this

117
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.880
okay

118
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.919
same you can do also for holes

119
00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.039
but now you express the holes as

120
00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.240
n times p equals

121
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.759
ni squared e to the q va over

122
00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:42.800
kt like this and

123
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.960
p is this whole thing

124
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.319
divided by n okay so we'll just carry

125
00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:57.840
this expression

126
00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.520
over here and you

127
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.560
then multiply through with the exponent

128
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.560
and you have an expression like this

129
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.319
you have a symmetric um x

130
00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:13.360
expression you have constant

131
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.560
donors um holes

132
00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.840
according to the acceptors on the p side

133
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.759
and you have an exponentially decaying

134
00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:24.080
number of holes

135
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.199
throughout the rest of the device all

136
00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:27.759
right

137
00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:30.000
now let's see what we can do with this

138
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.560
for junction recombination

139
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.000
we want to evaluate this expression and

140
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.680
we want to make our life a little bit

141
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.520
easier introduce some

142
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.639
say helper coordinates where we

143
00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:44.800
introduce a potential u that is now

144
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.000
normalized

145
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.280
by kt

146
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.639
and we'll do this for the applied

147
00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:55.599
voltage as well

148
00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.520
and we rewrite the expression for the

149
00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.280
relaxation

150
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.680
rate here in terms of these u's okay

151
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.639
so nothing really fancy going on so far

152
00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:13.520
but what i'll do is i'll pull out this

153
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.560
term

154
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.919
ua over 2 out of the exponent

155
00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:21.120
on the top okay

156
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.160
and i see something up here that begins

157
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:24.800
to look

158
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.599
familiar if you're familiar with

159
00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:31.840
additions and subtractions of complex

160
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.160
exponentials

161
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.240
complex exponentials would be sines and

162
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.639
cosines

163
00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:41.039
decaying exponentials are hyperbolic

164
00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:43.120
sines and hyperbolic cosines

165
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.840
so we can basically reformulate these

166
00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.720
expressions

167
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.879
to in the form of hyperbolic sines and

168
00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:52.160
cosines

169
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.240
all right and then ultimately we want to

170
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.280
expre integrate the expression for

171
00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.960
delta n over the depletion region

172
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.360
here right good now

173
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.720
this we we only need to keep the terms

174
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.160
that are dependent on x

175
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.199
in the expression and that is our term u

176
00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:13.599
here

177
00:08:13.599 --> 00:08:17.039
so the hyperbolic cosine under the hood

178
00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:20.160
stays in the integral

179
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.240
and we'll start trying to solve this

180
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.160
integral okay now

181
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.319
one approximation and again keep in mind

182
00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:31.280
this comes from

183
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.360
sort of the 50s people not having

184
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.519
significant compute resources and they

185
00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:40.159
try to get again analytical insight

186
00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:42.399
one step you can do is you can just keep

187
00:08:42.399 --> 00:08:44.480
the positive branch of this hyperbolic

188
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.600
cosine

189
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.040
okay so you approximate that with just

190
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.320
the positive branch and leave

191
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.920
delete the negative branch in the

192
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.080
hyperbolic cosine

193
00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.680
then you can make an approximation

194
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.640
that you instead of having an electric

195
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.600
field that is really

196
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.560
spatially varying you can clip it to

197
00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.800
some max value

198
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.600
and assume that it's constant inside so

199
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.360
if you do that

200
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.839
you can come up with an expression for

201
00:09:17.839 --> 00:09:19.200
the

202
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.120
junction of recombination and forward

203
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.519
bias okay

204
00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:27.279
and that's the expression

205
00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:30.720
and notice the exponent of two

206
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.160
or one-half in this case this expression

207
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.600
here the component here

208
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.240
corresponds to a spatial effective

209
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.640
spatial width

210
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.839
and the excess carriers at mid junction

211
00:09:43.839 --> 00:09:47.040
with a factor of 100 one half

212
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.560
indicates that you have um

213
00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.640
due to traps and the traps are hidden

214
00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.480
here in this towel okay so that's the

215
00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.800
the lifetime the traps the properties of

216
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.920
the traps

217
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.120
so if you're pnn junction

218
00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.880
behaves with this factor of one half

219
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.760
you know that down here in this region

220
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.320
you have

221
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.920
traps in your

222
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.079
in the depletion region and you need to

223
00:10:18.079 --> 00:10:20.399
do some more about the quality

224
00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:23.600
of your pn junction now

225
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.680
there's this dungeon design

226
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.279
considerations

227
00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:30.839
um you know of the corner effect if you

228
00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:35.920
studied electrostatics it's a typical

229
00:10:36.079 --> 00:10:40.880
effect where you if you have a

230
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.040
two plate capacitors right you have

231
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.800
electric fields that

232
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.560
that run very parallel if you

233
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.680
have a point then

234
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.160
all your electric field lines are coming

235
00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.600
to the point

236
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.000
and you have a strong electric field

237
00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.279
coinciding

238
00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:03.200
um on on on strong points or corners

239
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.000
the same is true when you have real pn

240
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.360
junctions that are

241
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.839
in planar design you might have designed

242
00:11:09.839 --> 00:11:11.519
a junction

243
00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:14.160
with this kind of design in mind where

244
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.000
you might have a linear

245
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.880
cut through in mind as we had sketched

246
00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.880
in the beginning of these segments

247
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.040
but in three dimensions you really have

248
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.120
more complicated corners and you have a

249
00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.320
corner effect

250
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.320
and you might have to do something to

251
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.200
get a better performance

252
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.079
in your recombination all right now

253
00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:35.200
let's look at the

254
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.760
depletion

255
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.480
sorry in the reverse bias and let's look

256
00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.000
at um

257
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.720
structure where we have now reverse bias

258
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.040
and a pretty large depletion width

259
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.920
we had to sketch that as you apply a

260
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.839
stronger bias you pull

261
00:11:51.839 --> 00:11:56.079
apart the depletion regions even further

262
00:11:56.079 --> 00:11:58.000
let's remind ourselves again of this

263
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.040
glorious shockley reed hall expression

264
00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.480
that is pretty long and we'll do the

265
00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.959
same approximation of what we just did

266
00:12:04.959 --> 00:12:07.360
a minute or two ago we assume that the

267
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.040
taus are identical

268
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.320
traps are mid-gap and one and p1 are

269
00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.360
then at mid-gap meaning an i

270
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.600
and we have an expression just like what

271
00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.720
we just

272
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.920
had written down now

273
00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.040
if i'm at a negative bias you can see

274
00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:25.600
that

275
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.639
this term is negligibly small

276
00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:31.920
okay and you end up

277
00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.720
with it and you can neglect these ends

278
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.639
and you basically end up with

279
00:12:36.639 --> 00:12:40.720
ni over two tau okay

280
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.000
so here we are we have a recombination

281
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.600
in the depletion region

282
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.519
which is something we had calculated

283
00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:49.040
before

284
00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.600
and we had calculated before if you have

285
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.160
a

286
00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.480
depletion region like this and you have

287
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.399
a constant

288
00:12:56.399 --> 00:12:59.680
recombination rate

289
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.839
you end up having

290
00:13:04.839 --> 00:13:07.600
um an expression like this

291
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.600
where the current is now proportional

292
00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.040
to your depletion region um

293
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.079
width okay

294
00:13:18.079 --> 00:13:21.600
and we know that we had written down

295
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.639
that this width

296
00:13:22.639 --> 00:13:25.839
here is proportional

297
00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:29.839
to some vbi minus va

298
00:13:29.839 --> 00:13:33.440
just like here okay so that now means

299
00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.480
that

300
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.240
your current is dependent on

301
00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.240
uh the depletion width and therefore

302
00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.320
with the voltage and it goes as a square

303
00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.199
root

304
00:13:43.199 --> 00:13:46.240
okay so instead of having a flat

305
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.839
voltage independent reverse current

306
00:13:49.839 --> 00:13:52.800
you have more current flowing that goes

307
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.839
with the square root of the voltage

308
00:13:55.839 --> 00:13:59.360
so again this is another mechanism

309
00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.440
to probe for traps in the junction

310
00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.000
all right so we talked about junction

311
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.279
recombination

312
00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:08.800
next step is we're going to talk about

313
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.040
tunneling

314
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:15.440
now here's a so-called isaki diode

315
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.440
isaki was the person that really

316
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.720
explained this well

317
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.839
and had some insight and what he did is

318
00:14:21.839 --> 00:14:22.399
he

319
00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:25.040
he not only sketched this into a

320
00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:25.680
notebook

321
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.079
like nice did a couple of years before

322
00:14:28.079 --> 00:14:30.320
him but he actually measured this

323
00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.600
now this uh asaki

324
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.720
tunnel diode behavior behave only occurs

325
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.839
if you have a very heavily doped diode

326
00:14:39.839 --> 00:14:43.519
so here's a diode sketch

327
00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:45.279
in equilibrium that looks a little

328
00:14:45.279 --> 00:14:47.839
different from what we had seen before

329
00:14:47.839 --> 00:14:51.360
these are now degenerately dulled diodes

330
00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.959
so the fermi level

331
00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:55.680
is actually above the conduction band

332
00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.480
edge and the fermi level for holes

333
00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.680
is below the valence band edge

334
00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:06.240
and notice that the built-in potential

335
00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.279
now is actually larger than the gap

336
00:15:09.279 --> 00:15:11.440
so early on we postulated maybe that's

337
00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.680
that's the biggest uh

338
00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.519
built-in potential you can come up with

339
00:15:15.519 --> 00:15:17.120
but if you actually have very heavy

340
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.800
doping devices

341
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.959
you can build in a potential that is

342
00:15:20.959 --> 00:15:23.120
larger than the gap

343
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.839
now if you compare this kind of behavior

344
00:15:25.839 --> 00:15:28.560
to the traditional

345
00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:33.680
iv of a perfect diffusion limited

346
00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.000
pn junction that is a perfect

347
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:36.959
exponential

348
00:15:36.959 --> 00:15:40.399
and you begin to apply a voltage

349
00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:42.079
you find that there is some strange

350
00:15:42.079 --> 00:15:44.399
behavior the current goes up

351
00:15:44.399 --> 00:15:47.600
and it then goes down and then begins to

352
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.600
follow the normal

353
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.560
iv characteristics of the device so

354
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.839
where does this come from

355
00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.399
um you can sketch it like this so you're

356
00:15:58.399 --> 00:16:01.120
going in forward bias you're raising up

357
00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:05.040
the quasi-fermi level for the electrons

358
00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.160
and what you're finding is that on the p

359
00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.199
side now you have empty states and

360
00:16:11.199 --> 00:16:13.839
electrons will start to tunnel through

361
00:16:13.839 --> 00:16:15.040
this device

362
00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.639
and current grows more than it would

363
00:16:18.639 --> 00:16:19.920
have grown

364
00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.759
if the electrons were going over here as

365
00:16:23.759 --> 00:16:25.600
diffusion

366
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.839
injected now if you increase the voltage

367
00:16:29.839 --> 00:16:33.600
further eventually you hit a point where

368
00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.560
this sea of electrons does not have

369
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.079
according

370
00:16:38.079 --> 00:16:41.120
empty states available on the p

371
00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.240
side so then there's no more injection

372
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.160
and then the device begins to just

373
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.000
behave like a normal diode where you

374
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.040
inject minority carriers on this side

375
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.199
okay so that's a so-called asakui diode

376
00:16:55.199 --> 00:16:56.480
and leo isaki got

377
00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.680
a nobel prize for that because

378
00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.480
it really revealed that indeed a band

379
00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.040
gap

380
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.199
exists and you can tunnel across a band

381
00:17:05.199 --> 00:17:06.240
gap

382
00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.679
and this was a significant discovery in

383
00:17:09.679 --> 00:17:11.039
the field of

384
00:17:11.039 --> 00:17:14.559
semiconductor devices all right

385
00:17:14.559 --> 00:17:17.520
so if you do this in reverse heavily

386
00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.319
biased

387
00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:22.240
device or actually any device

388
00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.359
pn junction can do this under a strong

389
00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:28.400
reverse bias what happens is you

390
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:32.799
uncover empty states here

391
00:17:32.799 --> 00:17:36.400
and hold electrons can tunnel over

392
00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.600
here this way and they have empty states

393
00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.799
so you have

394
00:17:40.799 --> 00:17:43.679
full bands here so the electrons are

395
00:17:43.679 --> 00:17:44.799
occupying

396
00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:47.520
states but they can tunnel over through

397
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.799
the barriers into empty states

398
00:17:50.799 --> 00:17:53.440
now if you increase the bias further

399
00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.840
you'll have more kernel

400
00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.600
tunneling current as you expose more

401
00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.200
states also

402
00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.320
you narrow the tunneling barrier

403
00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.400
and you can visualize it like this

404
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.559
effectively these electrons start to see

405
00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:09.840
a triangular

406
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.679
tunneling barrier and you can calculate

407
00:18:11.679 --> 00:18:13.360
that explicitly

408
00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.360
and you might have read that in your

409
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.280
textbook or you might have done an

410
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.400
exercise

411
00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.440
where you calculated that tunneling as

412
00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.320
you increase

413
00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.600
a higher bias this triangular barrier

414
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.559
becomes

415
00:18:26.559 --> 00:18:29.360
narrower and therefore it increases the

416
00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.160
tunneling

417
00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.160
so this tunneling through a triangular

418
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.840
barrier you can carry through

419
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.160
there's an example in your textbook or

420
00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.160
you can

421
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:42.720
calculate that as a homework exercise

422
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.760
all right so

423
00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.559
uh we've made it through pretty much all

424
00:18:48.559 --> 00:18:49.200
of the

425
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.720
various regions of the iv

426
00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.240
characteristics

427
00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.600
and let me begin to summarize that

428
00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.679
these different slopes that we

429
00:18:57.679 --> 00:19:00.640
identified

430
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:05.520
one half here one and two

431
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.160
and the square root behavior like this

432
00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.640
are indications for the quality of your

433
00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.600
device

434
00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.039
how many traps do you have how high is

435
00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:18.320
your doping

436
00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.640
and it allows you to characterize your

437
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.760
device

438
00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.679
so again when you run new measurements

439
00:19:25.679 --> 00:19:28.480
on new devices people will ask you what

440
00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:28.799
is

441
00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:31.919
your ideality factor of your

442
00:19:31.919 --> 00:19:34.320
iv characteristic and those would be

443
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.960
these exponents people refer to

444
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.720
now of course you can calculate all of

445
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.880
these things numerically now with

446
00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:41.679
engines

447
00:19:41.679 --> 00:19:46.480
that have these processes built in

448
00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:50.240
but you still end up finding that these

449
00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.600
exponentials really

450
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.280
are meaningful and they allow you to

451
00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.200
get a full understanding of what is

452
00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.960
going on in the device that a pure

453
00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.919
numerical calculation would not reveal

454
00:20:01.919 --> 00:20:04.080
so with that i thank you very much for

455
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.159
your attention

456
00:20:06.159 --> 00:20:10.320
okay so we just talked about

457
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.240
tunneling let me talk about impact

458
00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.280
ionization now

459
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.880
all right and that's really talking

460
00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.039
about breakdown in the realistic

461
00:20:19.039 --> 00:20:22.400
structure and avalanche breakdown

462
00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.679
all right so if you have a junction in

463
00:20:25.679 --> 00:20:27.200
reverse bias

464
00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.520
you might have some electrons that are

465
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.320
still

466
00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.960
around even in the reverse bias

467
00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.559
configuration

468
00:20:34.559 --> 00:20:37.760
and they might sort of trickle down and

469
00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.679
interact with phonons and lose their

470
00:20:39.679 --> 00:20:41.120
energy that way

471
00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.039
okay so that would be a reverse biased

472
00:20:43.039 --> 00:20:45.200
flow of

473
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.760
electrons now imagine that you have a

474
00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.360
really high

475
00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:53.280
bias applied to your device and somehow

476
00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.760
you have this straight electron that is

477
00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.360
up here

478
00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.559
and let's say it has an energy that is

479
00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:02.799
typically three half the band gap let's

480
00:21:02.799 --> 00:21:05.280
assume that it actually travels

481
00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:09.360
over here and gains a lot of kinetic

482
00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.880
energy

483
00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:15.039
so as it generates or gains a bunch of

484
00:21:15.039 --> 00:21:16.400
kinetic energy

485
00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:20.000
it can actually kick up

486
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.200
a an electron that sits down here kick

487
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.480
up and generate

488
00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:28.159
another electron okay

489
00:21:28.159 --> 00:21:31.360
and it generates a hole that can can

490
00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:31.919
then

491
00:21:31.919 --> 00:21:35.039
flow this way these two electrons

492
00:21:35.039 --> 00:21:38.880
now can travel forward

493
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:43.280
gain a bunch of energy fall down

494
00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.480
and gener each generate uh four more

495
00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.679
electron

496
00:21:47.679 --> 00:21:50.400
well each two more meaning now we have

497
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.000
two holes here

498
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.799
that will travel forward okay so you're

499
00:21:54.799 --> 00:21:56.000
going from one

500
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.240
to two to four plus you go

501
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.840
one to two on holes now imagine this

502
00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.039
keeps going

503
00:22:05.039 --> 00:22:08.720
you go here to eight

504
00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:12.240
and here to four okay so you have an

505
00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.280
avalanche effect that uh

506
00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.799
given enough energy these electrons can

507
00:22:18.799 --> 00:22:21.520
excite other electrons from the valence

508
00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.159
band into the conduction band

509
00:22:24.159 --> 00:22:26.159
create more electrons and they can

510
00:22:26.159 --> 00:22:28.240
create more holes that can also then

511
00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:32.400
impact ionized so that's an exponential

512
00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:36.320
growth and it's called impact ionization

513
00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:36.960
or

514
00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.039
and ultimately it leads to a breakdown

515
00:22:39.039 --> 00:22:41.280
of a junction

516
00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:46.240
okay now here's an animation of this

517
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.320
where the carriers basically start to

518
00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.520
multiply

519
00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.640
okay good

520
00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.880
so can we calculate this now

521
00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.799
here's an empirical answer to the

522
00:22:58.799 --> 00:23:01.039
problem where we say well

523
00:23:01.039 --> 00:23:05.200
the current at a space x plus delta x

524
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:09.120
is dependent on the original current

525
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.799
plus some current that is generated

526
00:23:12.799 --> 00:23:15.360
within the distance delta x due to

527
00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:15.919
impact

528
00:23:15.919 --> 00:23:18.400
ionization there are some coefficients

529
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.039
alpha n

530
00:23:19.039 --> 00:23:22.320
and alpha p that identify

531
00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.919
or scale the probabilities of such

532
00:23:25.919 --> 00:23:29.200
impact ionization to happen and

533
00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.559
these terms can then grow exponentially

534
00:23:32.559 --> 00:23:35.760
along the device okay

535
00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.480
so you can build the differential of

536
00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.120
this

537
00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.720
and you end up with a differential

538
00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:46.080
equation that looks like this all right

539
00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:51.760
so so far nothing really fancy going on

540
00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.679
one thing to that we're going to

541
00:23:53.679 --> 00:23:55.600
simplify things with

542
00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.840
at steady state the total current

543
00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.120
is the sum of the

544
00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.679
electron current and the the hole

545
00:24:05.679 --> 00:24:06.159
current

546
00:24:06.159 --> 00:24:08.799
that is being generated in this impact

547
00:24:08.799 --> 00:24:10.640
ionization so we're going to write it

548
00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.760
like this

549
00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.720
where we can substitute the whole

550
00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.279
current

551
00:24:15.279 --> 00:24:17.919
by an expression of the electron current

552
00:24:17.919 --> 00:24:18.960
okay

553
00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.880
again nothing fancy here

554
00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:27.919
and what we're going to do is now bring

555
00:24:27.919 --> 00:24:31.600
the total current to the right

556
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.039
right hand side and are left with

557
00:24:35.039 --> 00:24:39.840
a differential equation like this

558
00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.080
okay

559
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.039
now we can

560
00:24:47.039 --> 00:24:48.960
solve this differential equation and

561
00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.279
this looks a little bit like

562
00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:55.440
a y prime minus a y equals b

563
00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.720
the general solution to that

564
00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.120
integral looks like this the

565
00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.279
non-definite integral like this

566
00:25:03.279 --> 00:25:07.440
except now these alphas here

567
00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:11.120
and i ns are a functions of x

568
00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.679
so it gets a little bit more complicated

569
00:25:13.679 --> 00:25:14.320
so the

570
00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.360
the true solution to the differential

571
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.080
equation

572
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:22.480
includes these double complex integrals

573
00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.039
and we'll try need to introduce a couple

574
00:25:25.039 --> 00:25:26.039
of

575
00:25:26.039 --> 00:25:29.440
approximations to this solution okay so

576
00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.720
first of all

577
00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:34.320
we'll assume that uh the the current

578
00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.760
up here the initial little trigger

579
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.880
that of an electron flow into the system

580
00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.679
is negligibly small certainly compared

581
00:25:43.679 --> 00:25:44.880
to the final

582
00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.799
current that is flowing after the

583
00:25:46.799 --> 00:25:48.720
avalanche happens

584
00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.760
okay so that's

585
00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:57.840
assumption number one

586
00:25:58.559 --> 00:26:02.080
and then we assume that um down here at

587
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:02.880
the

588
00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.360
hole side at the end of the depletion

589
00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:06.480
region there

590
00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.919
that also the initial hole current

591
00:26:09.919 --> 00:26:12.000
is zero so everything is really

592
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.600
generated inside

593
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.279
of the depletion region like this so

594
00:26:17.279 --> 00:26:19.919
we had said that the total current is

595
00:26:19.919 --> 00:26:20.320
the

596
00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.760
electron current plus the whole current

597
00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:28.000
if we evaluate the total current which

598
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.200
is continuous

599
00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.440
in in the different slices just here at

600
00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.039
this region w

601
00:26:33.039 --> 00:26:36.240
we can say that the total current

602
00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.640
is approximately to the electron current

603
00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.520
that is being generated

604
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.480
through avalanching

605
00:26:44.559 --> 00:26:48.480
total uh electron avalanche current

606
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:52.799
at the side w okay

607
00:26:52.799 --> 00:26:55.440
and we introduce a factor it's called

608
00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.919
the multiplication factor that's

609
00:26:57.919 --> 00:27:00.640
how many more times total current do you

610
00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.520
get out

611
00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.080
compared to the electron current you

612
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.039
stuck in

613
00:27:05.039 --> 00:27:08.960
here okay

614
00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.279
so

615
00:27:12.159 --> 00:27:14.240
so far we actually haven't done this

616
00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.440
approximation here

617
00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.840
okay all right so now i'm plugging in

618
00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:18.880
these coefficients

619
00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.600
into this horrendous looking exponential

620
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.320
integral

621
00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:25.039
and it looks pretty horrendous still let

622
00:27:25.039 --> 00:27:26.159
me see what other

623
00:27:26.159 --> 00:27:28.799
approximations i can do so first of all

624
00:27:28.799 --> 00:27:30.720
i'm just multiplying out

625
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:34.159
the denominator all across

626
00:27:34.159 --> 00:27:39.200
and i can see that i cancel a couple of

627
00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.240
terms

628
00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:44.000
over here and i

629
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.840
am bringing um

630
00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:55.039
so here is this one right this guy

631
00:27:55.039 --> 00:27:58.240
turns to b1 that's the one here

632
00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.520
that's the one here i'm bringing the one

633
00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.559
over or bring the 1 minus 1 over m

634
00:28:04.559 --> 00:28:07.919
over all right now i'm assuming that the

635
00:28:07.919 --> 00:28:09.039
multiplication

636
00:28:09.039 --> 00:28:11.760
is so tremendously large that i can

637
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.120
neglect this term

638
00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.320
so i call this 1. so now we're stuck

639
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.679
with

640
00:28:17.679 --> 00:28:20.799
still a pretty complicated integral

641
00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:24.080
having the value of 1.

642
00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.880
next we're going to assume that alpha n

643
00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.320
equals alpha p

644
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:31.200
that the generation avalanche generation

645
00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.279
probability of for the two carriers is

646
00:28:33.279 --> 00:28:34.480
the same

647
00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.440
can't be quite right because electrons

648
00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.880
are lighter than the

649
00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.080
holes they should um be

650
00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:45.200
uh generating other electrons

651
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.240
easier but we'll assume it anyways

652
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.520
if that's the case then you lose this

653
00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:54.000
horrendous exponential up there and we

654
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.880
don't need to integrate over the details

655
00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.200
of this alpha n and alpha p as a

656
00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.880
function of x

657
00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:03.440
okay so

658
00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.799
not the complex exponential here now the

659
00:29:06.799 --> 00:29:08.720
next assumption is we actually assume

660
00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.960
that these co this coefficient is

661
00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.960
constant throughout

662
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.919
the junction and the key element to

663
00:29:15.919 --> 00:29:17.360
understand is that most

664
00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.200
avalanche happens roughly in the middle

665
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.720
of the junction because that's where the

666
00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:21.279
electric

667
00:29:21.279 --> 00:29:24.559
field is really the largest so

668
00:29:24.559 --> 00:29:27.600
if we assume that then alpha n

669
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:32.799
times w turns one and there's a bunch of

670
00:29:32.799 --> 00:29:35.919
experimental evidence and a bunch of

671
00:29:35.919 --> 00:29:38.080
theory where faculty have spent

672
00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.640
loads of their research time trying to

673
00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.679
figure out

674
00:29:41.679 --> 00:29:44.559
what these avalanche probability

675
00:29:44.559 --> 00:29:46.399
coefficients are

676
00:29:46.399 --> 00:29:50.399
so there's an abundance of research on

677
00:29:50.399 --> 00:29:51.120
this

678
00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.880
where you can look this up in

679
00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.520
publications and textbooks

680
00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.640
and you can then relate this avalanche

681
00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.039
to a particular breakdown field

682
00:30:01.039 --> 00:30:04.480
and given a certain if you reach this

683
00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.000
breakdown field

684
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.600
you can then expect avalanche

685
00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:13.520
to happen in reverse biased devices

686
00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:17.120
all right so this amp impact ionization

687
00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.600
can be a pretty bad thing or it can be

688
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.799
very good

689
00:30:20.799 --> 00:30:24.240
now imagine in a good

690
00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.360
circumstance where you have um

691
00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.559
an electron maybe uh about

692
00:30:30.559 --> 00:30:33.919
ready to be uh injected there maybe it's

693
00:30:33.919 --> 00:30:34.960
a single

694
00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:38.080
photon that you can absorb by

695
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.799
generating exactly one electron hole

696
00:30:40.799 --> 00:30:41.600
pair

697
00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.799
but you generate it right

698
00:30:44.799 --> 00:30:47.440
teter tottering well if this electron

699
00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.679
falls it will multiply into many

700
00:30:49.679 --> 00:30:52.320
electrons and you can measure that

701
00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.919
now that's a avalanche photodetector

702
00:30:55.919 --> 00:30:59.440
so that's a very cool thing to to

703
00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.559
utilize this avalanche effect now

704
00:31:02.559 --> 00:31:05.519
there can be bad things if you're again

705
00:31:05.519 --> 00:31:07.679
in a realistic device and you have

706
00:31:07.679 --> 00:31:09.679
stray fields on corners where the

707
00:31:09.679 --> 00:31:11.440
electric fields are much larger than you

708
00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.799
expected them to be

709
00:31:12.799 --> 00:31:15.200
and you can lead to breakdown so now

710
00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.559
this can lead to

711
00:31:16.559 --> 00:31:18.480
some engineering solutions that you may

712
00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.559
be pursuing

713
00:31:20.559 --> 00:31:23.279
where you want to reduce the electric

714
00:31:23.279 --> 00:31:24.080
field

715
00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:27.519
at a particular junction

716
00:31:27.519 --> 00:31:30.840
and this can be done for example by

717
00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.240
inserting

718
00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:35.679
between the the p and the n region

719
00:31:35.679 --> 00:31:38.399
inserting an intrinsic region an i

720
00:31:38.399 --> 00:31:39.360
region

721
00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:43.120
and what that does is it effectively

722
00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.000
clips

723
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.720
the maximum amplitude of the electric

724
00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:47.519
field and

725
00:31:47.519 --> 00:31:50.240
spreads out the electric field in space

726
00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.120
because

727
00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:55.200
the total area under this curve

728
00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:58.799
will be the same in this kind of design

729
00:31:58.799 --> 00:32:04.080
but you've clipped the maximum

730
00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.640
electric field and the area is the same

731
00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.080
because the vbi

732
00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.000
is the same that you built into the

733
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.679
device because that's again just

734
00:32:11.679 --> 00:32:13.679
determined by the doping

735
00:32:13.679 --> 00:32:16.080
of the p and the n region so by

736
00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:16.880
inserting

737
00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:20.240
a thin layer here that might be

738
00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.159
intrinsically doped

739
00:32:22.159 --> 00:32:25.200
you can cut down on on the

740
00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.399
the peak electric fields and that was a

741
00:32:28.399 --> 00:32:31.120
pretty important design feature for

742
00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.799
mosfets

743
00:32:32.799 --> 00:32:35.440
where they needed to reduce the fields

744
00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.960
on the drain side

745
00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.480
to increase the

746
00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.679
reliability of these devices

747
00:32:43.679 --> 00:32:47.279
all right finally there's an aspect of

748
00:32:47.279 --> 00:32:48.000
something called

749
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.679
dead space in today's devices that are

750
00:32:51.679 --> 00:32:53.200
extremely

751
00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.240
small extremely short where this width

752
00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:00.080
may be very small electrons may never

753
00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:04.399
actually scatter inside the device they

754
00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:05.760
might actually

755
00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.080
reach

756
00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:11.679
the other device and before they have a

757
00:33:11.679 --> 00:33:12.480
chance

758
00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:15.679
to um avalon

759
00:33:15.679 --> 00:33:17.440
so you might have ballistic junctions

760
00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.440
where the electrons shoot straight

761
00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.240
through

762
00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:25.360
without inducing impact ionization

763
00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.000
and the lingo here is that that space

764
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.760
that will

765
00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:34.000
allow the electron to really accelerate

766
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.600
is too small in order to for impact

767
00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.480
ionization to happen

768
00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.519
okay we're going to close down now with

769
00:33:43.519 --> 00:33:44.720
a

770
00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.919
discussion on how to distinguish zener

771
00:33:47.919 --> 00:33:49.519
breakdown versus

772
00:33:49.519 --> 00:33:51.200
impact ionization because they're

773
00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.840
similar effects right you have the

774
00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.399
avalanching here and you could have

775
00:33:56.399 --> 00:33:58.559
zener tunneling and reverse bias how do

776
00:33:58.559 --> 00:34:00.960
you distinguish between these two

777
00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:04.080
well you can do so by a couple of

778
00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:07.600
different measurements number one

779
00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:12.320
for impact ionization to happen

780
00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.839
you need to have a bias that is at least

781
00:34:15.839 --> 00:34:18.079
larger than the band gap otherwise you

782
00:34:18.079 --> 00:34:20.389
don't have carriers that can

783
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:22.079
[Music]

784
00:34:22.079 --> 00:34:24.800
generate as much energy as to need to

785
00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:25.918
cause avalanching

786
00:34:25.918 --> 00:34:29.839
okay so for impact ionization

787
00:34:29.839 --> 00:34:31.839
you need bias so if you have a breakdown

788
00:34:31.839 --> 00:34:33.679
a zener breakdown

789
00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:36.639
for a device that is close to one av

790
00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:37.679
when your

791
00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:39.679
band gap is roughly one av then you must

792
00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:42.879
have zener breakdown rather than

793
00:34:42.879 --> 00:34:45.919
avalanche breakdown

794
00:34:46.079 --> 00:34:50.159
now so this so this means

795
00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:52.480
the zener tunneling can happen for some

796
00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.000
relatively small

797
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.119
reverse biases now there's another

798
00:34:57.119 --> 00:35:00.880
aspect to the impact ionization that is

799
00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:03.280
the noise behavior of the device

800
00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.920
now if you generate all these carriers

801
00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.000
by impact ionization

802
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.480
this is a very noisy behavior and you

803
00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.440
can measure that

804
00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:14.240
in your signal in your time variant

805
00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:16.320
behavior of the electronics

806
00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.240
so it's very noisy versus the zener

807
00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.599
tunneling

808
00:35:19.599 --> 00:35:22.880
is relatively smooth compared to that

809
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.839
all right so i think we're reaching the

810
00:35:25.839 --> 00:35:26.720
end of this

811
00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.599
this section um the junction

812
00:35:29.599 --> 00:35:31.599
recombination is often used to

813
00:35:31.599 --> 00:35:35.119
diagnose processes in devices

814
00:35:35.119 --> 00:35:38.240
and uh diagnose the maturity of a

815
00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.280
of a device these

816
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.680
defects and junctions can be misplaced

817
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.720
donor or acceptors

818
00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:49.839
they may not be from deep traps it's

819
00:35:49.839 --> 00:35:52.160
just

820
00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:55.359
the thermodynamics of implants or

821
00:35:55.359 --> 00:35:59.520
etc might have not had the donors settle

822
00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.599
in into the appropriate crystal places

823
00:36:01.599 --> 00:36:04.320
and create trap states instead

824
00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.880
and impact ionization plays an important

825
00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:07.760
role

826
00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:10.880
in a vital variety of devices

827
00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:14.000
like photodiodes for example or

828
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.960
needs to be avoided at corner effects on

829
00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.520
three-dimensional geometries

830
00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.240
all right i think this is it for section

831
00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.000
20. so i thank you very much for your

832
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.119
attention

833
00:36:25.119 --> 00:36:27.839
bye
