WEBVTT

1
00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:06.879
yeah so in the last couple of classes we

2
00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:07.839
were talking about the cv

3
00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:09.040
characteristics and then

4
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.800
after the cv characteristics discussion

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.400
we were getting into

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.200
the secondary effects and these are the

7
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.199
list of effects that

8
00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.439
we supposed to discuss and as you said

9
00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.119
there are a few effects that will be

10
00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.320
having a glimpse of it

11
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.160
but the certain effects that i will go

12
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.720
in depth in the sense not too much of

13
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.720
depth at the level of physics but

14
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.240
certainly that would help us to

15
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.800
model the uh behavior okay so i'll just

16
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.559
try to model few of the behaviors of

17
00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.120
these

18
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.680
effects yeah so today we will just begin

19
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.879
with this discussion okay

20
00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.360
so in the last class when i started

21
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.320
talking about it

22
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.920
i said that this velocity saturation

23
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.520
effect is an effect that happens because

24
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.920
of the

25
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.440
lateral electric field okay so this is

26
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.000
an electric field that is created

27
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.800
because of the

28
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.320
vds okay due to this electrical uh field

29
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.600
between the source and the drain

30
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.520
there is some physical phenomena that is

31
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.160
happening to the ids

32
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.520
quantity okay this is what we are going

33
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.680
to study under this saturation effect so

34
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.000
in order to study the behavior of our

35
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
ideas when i have a lateral electric

36
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.439
field what i did is

37
00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.280
i took a very long channel device

38
00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.680
and using this long channel device i try

39
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.560
to derive the

40
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.400
relation of ideas okay so finally what

41
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.159
we found is that we found

42
00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:23.920
two different current equation one for

43
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.360
the linear region

44
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.920
okay we started with the expression of

45
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.200
qch by

46
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.439
transit time and that can be written as

47
00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.439
something like mu n cyx

48
00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.880
w by l and then

49
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.000
vgs minus vt minus vds by

50
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.960
2 into vds okay so this was the current

51
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.079
equation that we derived

52
00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.000
and in order to get the saturation

53
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.119
current equation

54
00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.119
what we did is that we just substituted

55
00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.040
our vds to be exactly equal to

56
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.200
vds sat and that value of vdsat was

57
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.159
equal to vgs minus vt okay so this is

58
00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.360
more important

59
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.200
so what i've done is like i try to

60
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.360
replace this vds

61
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.600
with vgs minus vt expression so when we

62
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.600
do so we end up having this current

63
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.160
equation

64
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.840
which i can write it as id sat or the

65
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.280
current in the saturation current as

66
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.000
something

67
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.360
like half mu n c o x

68
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.400
w by l into v g s minus v t the whole

69
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.800
square

70
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.800
okay so now let us try to plot this

71
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.080
behaviors of

72
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.200
of of long channel in terms of

73
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.040
graphs okay so i just want to plot them

74
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.319
one versus vgs id versus vgs

75
00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.239
the other one has ids versus vds

76
00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.239
and as i said this is the graph that we

77
00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.239
call it as a transfer catalystic graph

78
00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:40.959
because

79
00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.080
vgs would act as a kind of input voltage

80
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.160
whereas ids is nothing but an output

81
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.840
current so it's a plot between input and

82
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.920
output so due to which we call this a as

83
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.840
a kind of transfer characteristic graph

84
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.480
whereas the graph towards the right that

85
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.800
is ids versus vds we call this graph as

86
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.040
an output characteristic graph

87
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.959
okay and this one is just the transfer

88
00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.519
characteristic graph yeah yeah so now i

89
00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:06.080
hope that

90
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.080
you you might already know these answers

91
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.280
so just a quick

92
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.120
review of it we assume that the value of

93
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.680
ids is completely equal to zero

94
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.239
okay uh till i reach the value of regis

95
00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:16.720
that is

96
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.280
equal to vt and beyond that what happens

97
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.920
is that

98
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.879
you get some sort of current okay so

99
00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:23.599
again

100
00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.120
you will have different sets of graphs

101
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.040
for different values of vds

102
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.239
okay so we will restrict to a single

103
00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.400
value of vds here okay

104
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.000
and this is the kind of graph and when i

105
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.840
look here the particular region

106
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.760
where our transfer would be in

107
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.120
saturation assuming that

108
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.680
we have vds that is greater than zero

109
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.400
okay so

110
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.159
in this particular segment we first

111
00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.760
enter into saturation and then we get

112
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.000
into

113
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
linear okay so something like a kind of

114
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.200
a linear

115
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.040
relation will happen here but there are

116
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.400
certainly some sort of quadratic

117
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.000
relation happens at this particular zone

118
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.400
okay

119
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.159
now why does this quadratic relation

120
00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.000
happens when i try to plot ids versus

121
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.680
vgs

122
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.599
why does this graph takes a kind of

123
00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:02.799
quadratic nature

124
00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.239
like a kind of parabola at this

125
00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:05.360
particular junction and we are in

126
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.760
saturation regime

127
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.200
should we repeat the question now

128
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.159
uh when i try to plot ids versus vgs we

129
00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:15.680
know that the transistor

130
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.320
would be in cut off between the value of

131
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.639
vgs when it is equal to zero to vt

132
00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.800
right and after then it gets into

133
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.880
saturation within maybe

134
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.639
probably this graph might not tell you

135
00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.840
exactly why we are in saturation but

136
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.360
i think we know that whenever the value

137
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.280
of vds is greater than

138
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.960
vgs minus vt then this is the condition

139
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.800
for saturation okay so let us assume

140
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.440
that our

141
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.800
value of vds that i've plotted is

142
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.880
greater than zero so which means that

143
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.199
we have a positive value for our vds so

144
00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:48.479
in that case the moment i

145
00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:52.240
cross this vt the value of vgs minus vt

146
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.520
would be much smaller than the value of

147
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.360
vds that i have due to which from cut

148
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.800
off we will be entering into

149
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.360
saturation regime and after a while

150
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.160
we'll be

151
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.680
at the edge of the saturation and then

152
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.720
we will move on to linear region okay

153
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.680
so for an nmos device i think this these

154
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.520
equations we have already seen

155
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.039
so we assume that the value of ideas is

156
00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.960
equal to zero for transfer that is

157
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.639
in cut off and

158
00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.919
when the value of ideas is is not equal

159
00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:20.400
to zero

160
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.880
then there can be two possible regions

161
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.400
and the possibility of either of these

162
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.199
two regions

163
00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:26.960
depends on the value of vds and vgs

164
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.639
right so if i say i am in linear

165
00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.440
region the relation between the vds

166
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.400
and vgs can be returned something like

167
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.240
this okay when the value of v is smaller

168
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.160
than the value of v just minus v t

169
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.000
then we'll be in the linear region clear

170
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.880
but when i say that i'm in the

171
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.199
saturation.j

172
00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:53.680
then the value of vds supposed to be

173
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.479
greater than

174
00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.520
or equal to vgs minus vt

175
00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.319
correct so now the mode i cross this

176
00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:02.160
particular voltage i have some sort of

177
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.000
positive value of v gs minus vt

178
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.319
okay because this is my v g's axis and

179
00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:07.919
when i subtract the value of v t

180
00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:09.680
there will be a very small amount of

181
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.280
voltage that i will have across v g s

182
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.639
minus v t term okay

183
00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.160
and that value when i compare with

184
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.240
respect to radius it is quite smaller

185
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.000
due to which i am satisfying

186
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.400
the saturation region condition okay so

187
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.520
from cutoff

188
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.360
we are entering into saturation regime

189
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.120
first and then

190
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.000
once i increase the value of vgs for a

191
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.919
fixed value of vds i'm talking okay

192
00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:32.880
so as i keep increasing the value of vgs

193
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.000
what happens to the v g s minus

194
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.360
v d term that keeps rising and

195
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.440
momentarily we just move from this

196
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.240
saturation regime to linear region once

197
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.440
i have a huge value of v s minus v t

198
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.280
which is greater than the value of v d s

199
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.120
okay so this is how the travel so even

200
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.479
though if you're not comfortable

201
00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:52.800
with this way of writing i'll talk about

202
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.479
the same concept when we talk about dc

203
00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:55.440
characteristics of

204
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.479
cmos inverter okay but the only thing

205
00:06:58.479 --> 00:06:59.280
that i want to

206
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.039
emphasize here is that there is a kind

207
00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:02.639
of quadratic

208
00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:05.680
graph between the id and vgs when i try

209
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.080
to plot there is a kind of curvature

210
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.039
that you could see and this curvature

211
00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:12.000
represents a

212
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.759
quadratic relation between the id and

213
00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:15.759
the vgs so why does this quadratic

214
00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:18.639
relation appears

215
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.919
due to what

216
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.199
in the id set yeah

217
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.720
yeah there is a square exactly so there

218
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.639
is a square term that is sitting

219
00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:37.440
in this ids sat expression okay and due

220
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.080
to which

221
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.720
even for a small increment in the value

222
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.680
of vgs

223
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.879
the current is actually stepping bias

224
00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:46.960
factor of square okay and due to which

225
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.479
there is a quadratic relation and after

226
00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:48.960
then

227
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.440
you would see some sort of linear

228
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.680
relation between the id and vgs

229
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.479
okay so this is the nominal graph for a

230
00:07:56.479 --> 00:07:57.840
long channel device okay whatever i'm

231
00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.360
plotting is only for long channel device

232
00:07:59.360 --> 00:07:59.919
and i've

233
00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:02.160
still not had gone to the saturation

234
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.360
effect okay

235
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.199
and now we will just get into the other

236
00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:07.440
graph where i want to plot id versus

237
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.080
vds okay now again we know that there is

238
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.240
a kind of

239
00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.599
no current when the value of vgs is less

240
00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:16.560
than vt

241
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.479
okay but i would have certainly an

242
00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:20.319
amount of current for the value of

243
00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:22.639
vgs that is greater than vt okay so i'll

244
00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:24.800
just mark it as vgs one

245
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.560
and the next vgs2 will have a higher

246
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.960
value

247
00:08:31.919 --> 00:08:35.279
okay so each of these vgs

248
00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:37.519
are being incremented at an equal step

249
00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:38.880
okay so what does that mean is that

250
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.839
if i have say for example one volt the

251
00:08:41.839 --> 00:08:43.919
vgs2 would be like two word the vgs3

252
00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:45.200
will be like three volt and we just

253
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.240
would be like four volt

254
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.240
okay so the the difference between the

255
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.360
neighboring

256
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.160
voltages is all one word when i do so

257
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:52.720
you could see

258
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.959
that the currents were expanding is not

259
00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:56.080
equal okay

260
00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.160
it is not exactly incremented in the

261
00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.200
same equal step

262
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.880
heights okay the height difference

263
00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.000
between these two currents and the

264
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.959
height difference between these two

265
00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:03.920
currents are different

266
00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.279
okay and this again

267
00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:09.600
it's purely because of this square

268
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.720
relation that i have

269
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.040
okay because of any equal increment in

270
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.320
the value of vgs

271
00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.080
the current is being incremented by the

272
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.160
square term and due to which we would

273
00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.279
see some sort of

274
00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:21.680
unequal height differences in the value

275
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.920
of ideas versus vds graphs

276
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.880
okay hope that it is clear because these

277
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.240
are the graphs that will help us

278
00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.880
to see how does the plus station impacts

279
00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.440
our

280
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.519
cara okay this is what the current

281
00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:34.720
discussion is all about

282
00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.200
so now let us talk about short channel

283
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.200
device

284
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.800
so when i say short channel device we

285
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.320
are talking about a channel that is less

286
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.760
than one micrometer

287
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.760
under this condition our relation that i

288
00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.200
am trying to plot would be different

289
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.399
now what i mean by velocity saturation

290
00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:54.000
is that when i try to plot electric

291
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.080
field that is the lateral electric field

292
00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.680
versus the drift velocity okay

293
00:09:59.839 --> 00:10:01.360
we know that there exists a relation

294
00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.200
which is given by the classical physics

295
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.200
that the drift velocity is given by mu

296
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.720
times that of the electric field

297
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.399
okay we know that the electric field can

298
00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:09.839
be returned or the lateral electric

299
00:10:09.839 --> 00:10:10.800
field can be determined

300
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.519
as vds divided by that channel length

301
00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:13.920
and

302
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.000
the moment i reduce the channel length

303
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.120
say for example like

304
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.839
180 nanometer okay what happens is that

305
00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:20.800
even for small

306
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.720
values of vds that i have the electric

307
00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.000
field will suddenly

308
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.320
goes to a very very high value okay and

309
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.440
due to which

310
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.680
these electrons or the carriers the

311
00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.279
charge carriers attains

312
00:10:31.279 --> 00:10:34.399
a saturation velocity okay and it never

313
00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:35.040
follows this

314
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.959
expression okay so what i'm trying to

315
00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:38.079
mean is that

316
00:10:38.079 --> 00:10:40.320
during the small values of electric

317
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.360
field

318
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.920
the relation is generally followed given

319
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.360
by this particular

320
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.240
expression okay

321
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.880
but after attaining a particular

322
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.160
electric field which we called as

323
00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.959
critical electric field e c the velocity

324
00:10:54.959 --> 00:10:57.120
of the carriers becomes constant

325
00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.399
and it attains a saturated

326
00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:03.760
velocity here i guess this graph we have

327
00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.279
discussed in the last class as well

328
00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:08.480
okay now clearly this particular cara is

329
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.360
not

330
00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.120
reflected by this classical physics

331
00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.279
equation so we have to modify this drift

332
00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:17.040
velocity expression in order to

333
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.200
fit this particular carrot that the real

334
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.959
device actually shows the behavior

335
00:11:20.959 --> 00:11:23.600
okay so in order to reflect this

336
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.959
behavior

337
00:11:24.959 --> 00:11:26.880
i'm just going to slightly modify our

338
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.079
drift velocity

339
00:11:28.079 --> 00:11:32.079
expression okay so which is given as vds

340
00:11:32.079 --> 00:11:35.279
is equal to mu times that of the

341
00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:40.079
electric field divided by 1 plus

342
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.079
by ec okay so classically what we had

343
00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:44.560
was

344
00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.279
just the drift velocity was equal to mu

345
00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:48.240
times that of e

346
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.519
l but now in order to accommodate this

347
00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:53.519
particular carrot we have remodified

348
00:11:53.519 --> 00:11:55.360
this drift velocity expression

349
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.839
to something that looks like this okay

350
00:11:57.839 --> 00:11:58.480
now

351
00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.680
there are two things that we need to

352
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.760
observe here which means that

353
00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.519
for electric field that el that is

354
00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:07.120
far far lower than the value of this

355
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.880
critical electric field what happens to

356
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:09.440
the ratio

357
00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.639
when the lateral electric field is much

358
00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:12.240
smaller than the critical electric field

359
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.600
how i can approximate this drift

360
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.920
velocity term

361
00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.959
it would be still equal to ca

362
00:12:18.959 --> 00:12:22.720
into e l yeah so this would be still

363
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.720
following the classical physics okay

364
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.560
but the moment i am trying to get closer

365
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.320
and closer say for example

366
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.240
for the electric field that is exactly

367
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.920
equal to

368
00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.480
the critical electric field what happens

369
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.120
is that

370
00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.000
this drift velocity will become v sat

371
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.600
and what is the value of this v sat

372
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.160
when i try to plug in where e equal to e

373
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:42.800
c

374
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.160
then it becomes something like

375
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.480
this okay our velocity saturation is

376
00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.680
given by this particular

377
00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.839
expression and this expression is valid

378
00:12:53.839 --> 00:12:55.600
even for electric field that is greater

379
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.000
than

380
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.760
this critical electric field it stays

381
00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.079
constant okay and that constant value is

382
00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:02.560
evaluated based on this substitution

383
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.360
okay and we are keeping this as a kind

384
00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.000
of

385
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.800
ec and what we are plotting is with

386
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.160
respect to el okay

387
00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.320
so any further increase in the value of

388
00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.000
this lateral electric field

389
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.519
this quantity will be a kind of constant

390
00:13:17.519 --> 00:13:20.320
term okay yeah

391
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.040
sure you can ask sir uh like if you

392
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:23.519
increase

393
00:13:23.519 --> 00:13:28.720
el then won't dl by ec be more than one

394
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.959
yeah the drift velocity is actually

395
00:13:30.959 --> 00:13:32.800
being remapped into this expression okay

396
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.560
so we will will not be utilizing this

397
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.320
expression this is for the case

398
00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.240
when i am having an electric field that

399
00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.079
is less than the critical electric field

400
00:13:40.079 --> 00:13:41.279
okay so there are two different

401
00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:43.839
equations

402
00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.839
okay and this expression is valid only

403
00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:47.519
when i am working for an electric field

404
00:13:47.519 --> 00:13:48.160
that is

405
00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.240
less than the critical electric field

406
00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.360
but

407
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.839
according to the graph this drift

408
00:13:53.839 --> 00:13:54.480
velocity

409
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.920
would be equated to v sat when i

410
00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.160
have electric field that is greater than

411
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.160
the critical electric field so these are

412
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.040
the two different

413
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:07.199
equations okay okay

414
00:14:07.199 --> 00:14:09.760
yeah now let us try to evaluate the

415
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.959
current in the linear region

416
00:14:13.839 --> 00:14:17.199
okay now as i said uh the current

417
00:14:17.199 --> 00:14:18.720
equation as we did for the long channel

418
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.600
the current equation

419
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.120
can be written as the channel charge

420
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.720
divided by the transit time

421
00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.560
end up having something like mu times

422
00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.160
one plus our

423
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.040
lateral electric field divided by ec

424
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:29.440
okay

425
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.839
so you could clearly see that there is

426
00:14:31.839 --> 00:14:32.959
this particular term

427
00:14:32.959 --> 00:14:34.160
is happening just because of this

428
00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.040
particular substitution

429
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:40.000
so the t can be written as drift

430
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.519
velocity

431
00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:44.079
divided by the the length of the channel

432
00:14:44.079 --> 00:14:44.720
okay

433
00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.720
and then uh once you keep substituting

434
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.000
the qc edge which

435
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.959
i told the value of this qch was written

436
00:14:50.959 --> 00:14:53.040
as

437
00:14:54.959 --> 00:14:57.600
okay this vd which was our drift

438
00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.079
velocity

439
00:14:58.079 --> 00:15:00.639
can be represented by this expression

440
00:15:00.639 --> 00:15:03.040
which is

441
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.560
uh mu times el divided by 1 plus el

442
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.160
times of ec okay so i'm just trying to

443
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.680
substitute each of these quantities here

444
00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.399
okay

445
00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:13.440
did i write this properly no this is uh

446
00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.000
yeah so now that uh you just plug in the

447
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:16.720
value of this

448
00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.760
vd that we had over here because we are

449
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.040
in linear region okay

450
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.959
so in the linear region the value of vds

451
00:15:22.959 --> 00:15:24.160
is small

452
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.079
okay and you know which i'm just using

453
00:15:26.079 --> 00:15:27.760
this particular

454
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.199
expression rather than using this

455
00:15:29.199 --> 00:15:31.040
expression okay so

456
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.320
hope you're clear so i'm just

457
00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.079
substituting this equation just because

458
00:15:34.079 --> 00:15:35.279
the vds

459
00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:38.320
value is small

460
00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.680
due to which the lateral electric field

461
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.399
is

462
00:15:42.399 --> 00:15:44.160
lesser than the critical electric field

463
00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.600
and i am using this

464
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.240
vd expression to substitute over here so

465
00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.920
once you substitute you end up having

466
00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.680
some sort of beautiful expression

467
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.639
uh where mu would be there and there is

468
00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:56.240
also a critical electric field that

469
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.839
comes here okay and

470
00:15:59.839 --> 00:16:01.920
you have this entire equation which is

471
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.279
the qch

472
00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:05.839
expression

473
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.120
the blue one is basically due to the

474
00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.480
expression of qch and then

475
00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.560
so uh one thing that i can write is like

476
00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.959
el can also be written as a

477
00:16:16.959 --> 00:16:20.399
vds by pl channel length okay so we will

478
00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:22.880
hold this as well and uh due to which

479
00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.560
i'm going to substitute wherever i have

480
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:24.959
this

481
00:16:24.959 --> 00:16:28.880
el this is again el sorry yeah

482
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.720
so where i have this el i'm just going

483
00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.480
to utilize this expression

484
00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:37.839
so when you do so

485
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.079
okay so this vds expression is coming

486
00:16:42.079 --> 00:16:44.240
out of this el term that is sitting at

487
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.279
the top okay

488
00:16:45.279 --> 00:16:48.079
yeah so hope that it is clear so once i

489
00:16:48.079 --> 00:16:49.519
substitute all of these things this

490
00:16:49.519 --> 00:16:51.600
is the expression i have as a kind of

491
00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.199
current equation now i'm just going to

492
00:16:53.199 --> 00:16:54.000
introduce one

493
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.079
particular term which is known as kappa

494
00:16:56.079 --> 00:16:57.440
okay so i'm just

495
00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.279
going to rewrite this equation that i've

496
00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:00.959
written here equation number one

497
00:17:00.959 --> 00:17:03.360
in terms of kappa of something okay so i

498
00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.039
am just going to write it as kappa of

499
00:17:05.039 --> 00:17:07.439
vds

500
00:17:07.439 --> 00:17:10.480
into the normal equation which is

501
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.760
mu times cox w by l

502
00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.880
vgs minus vt minus vds

503
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.079
by 2 into vds okay so now when i look

504
00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:21.359
for the expression what is this

505
00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:24.319
kappa expression you could see just by

506
00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:25.760
making a comparison between the equation

507
00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.720
number 1 and 2

508
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:30.320
you could say that this kappa of vds

509
00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:35.039
is nothing but it's 1 upon 1 plus

510
00:17:35.039 --> 00:17:38.160
vds by ec times l

511
00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.039
okay now one can also write the product

512
00:17:41.039 --> 00:17:41.360
of

513
00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.000
ec into l as something known as critical

514
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:44.640
voltage

515
00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.200
so in the previous uh expression like

516
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.480
can you just like scroll a little

517
00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.520
upwards

518
00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.720
one okay uh there are actually el

519
00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:56.320
when we substitute vds by l

520
00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:00.240
then uh the w into l will becomes w

521
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:04.480
but then like how come w by actually

522
00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.960
there is one more t that is sitting here

523
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.000
right

524
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.080
so this t has something like l by v d

525
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.400
okay so already there was one l that is

526
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.440
coming out here

527
00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.280
because there is a cancellation so we

528
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.880
have two l's at the bottom

529
00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.880
okay one of the l will get cancelled

530
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.000
with this l

531
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.400
and uh one more l comes from the e l

532
00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.480
term

533
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.240
okay yeah yeah so now let us talk about

534
00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.240
this kappa of vds okay this couple of

535
00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.039
vds has a special meaning so it measures

536
00:18:35.039 --> 00:18:39.600
the degree of velocity saturation

537
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.400
okay now whenever we are dealing with

538
00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.440
something like

539
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.480
long channel device so when i say long

540
00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.760
channel device we are talking about the

541
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.960
length of the channel that is

542
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.720
much greater than one micrometer or

543
00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.880
whenever the value of vds is small

544
00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.760
okay 0.1.2 or 0.3 okay so when the

545
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.520
value of videos is small what happens to

546
00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.679
this kappa of vds okay we'll talk about

547
00:19:05.679 --> 00:19:07.440
both these quantities

548
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.919
okay so i'm taking two cases the first

549
00:19:09.919 --> 00:19:10.720
case

550
00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:14.080
is either i'm having a very long channel

551
00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.160
or either i'm having a very small value

552
00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.320
of vds what happens to this kappa

553
00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.400
what does this copper value ends up

554
00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.039
what happens to this ratio when when the

555
00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:26.320
value of v is small

556
00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:30.240
what happens to this ratio of vds by el

557
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.679
say for example when vds is equal to

558
00:19:31.679 --> 00:19:34.960
zero what happens this quantity becomes

559
00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:38.000
zero and due to which the kappa would

560
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.120
end up having a value that is equal to

561
00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.919
1 right so whenever we are dealing with

562
00:19:43.919 --> 00:19:45.840
the small value of vds we can assume

563
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.760
that the kappa

564
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.640
is equal to 1 okay which means that this

565
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.840
current equation

566
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.160
is as similar as that of the long

567
00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.520
channel current equation

568
00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.360
am i right this is the linear region

569
00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.360
current equation

570
00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.240
and when i deal with small value of v ds

571
00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.120
i am ending up having the

572
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.200
current equation that is similar to our

573
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.280
long channel linear current equation

574
00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.280
and also when i go for a channel length

575
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.039
that is greater than one micrometer what

576
00:20:13.039 --> 00:20:14.000
happens to this

577
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.200
quantity that is v ds by ec

578
00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:21.120
times l again this

579
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.000
quantity will become small okay which is

580
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:24.320
like

581
00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.000
closer to the value of zero again under

582
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.080
that condition also the kappa

583
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.640
of v or anything like kappa of v ds or

584
00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.919
copper of just v

585
00:20:31.919 --> 00:20:35.360
okay would then be equal to one okay so

586
00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:35.760
under

587
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.600
either of these two conditions the kappa

588
00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.120
takes up a value of one

589
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.480
here but what happens on the other hand

590
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.520
that is whenever we

591
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.159
deal with a shorter channel that is for

592
00:20:46.159 --> 00:20:48.480
length that is less than one micrometer

593
00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:52.799
okay or when the value of vds is large

594
00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:54.640
under this condition what value this

595
00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.039
copper would take then

596
00:20:57.039 --> 00:20:59.760
will it be higher than the value of one

597
00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.480
or it will be less than the value of one

598
00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.840
you want me to show the expression of

599
00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.600
kappa the kappa is expressed something

600
00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.000
like this

601
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.360
less than one so less than one yeah yeah

602
00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.280
so whenever we have a short channel or

603
00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.120
whenever we have a large value of vds in

604
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.400
a short channel okay so rather than

605
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.760
writing it as

606
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.320
r i would write it as and okay so this

607
00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.280
is a better quantity

608
00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.280
and rather than writing this kappa

609
00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.559
something like this okay i want to

610
00:21:26.559 --> 00:21:28.799
generalize this kappa term

611
00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:30.799
something like just cup of v how do i

612
00:21:30.799 --> 00:21:32.559
express this cup of v

613
00:21:32.559 --> 00:21:34.159
i'm just writing it as potential

614
00:21:34.159 --> 00:21:36.080
difference across any two terminal it

615
00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:36.799
can be either

616
00:21:36.799 --> 00:21:39.360
across vgs or it can be across vds so i

617
00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.280
want to generalize this kappa term

618
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.200
in terms of just v rather than specific

619
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.320
about

620
00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.960
v d s how do i express this kappa of v

621
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.720
so it is again taken from this

622
00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.360
expression just replace this

623
00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:56.159
v d s just with v right so when i do so

624
00:21:56.159 --> 00:21:57.679
i would end up having an expression

625
00:21:57.679 --> 00:21:58.640
which is written as

626
00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.400
1 divided by 1 plus v

627
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.400
divided by v c but if you are more

628
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.600
comfortable with

629
00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.679
writing in terms of critical electric

630
00:22:07.679 --> 00:22:08.640
field you can rewrite

631
00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.960
this expression again as ec times graph

632
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.880
l okay so either of these two forms are

633
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.320
conveying the same thing

634
00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.559
here yeah i'll tell you the reason why

635
00:22:16.559 --> 00:22:17.440
i'm writing

636
00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.080
as cup of v rather than cup of vds when

637
00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.760
we move on to saturation regime okay

638
00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.200
so now let us look for the current

639
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.440
equation in the saturation region

640
00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.640
for a short channel device but

641
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.159
here before i do the derivation

642
00:22:34.159 --> 00:22:35.919
i i just want to provide you some sort

643
00:22:35.919 --> 00:22:37.440
of node okay

644
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.919
so in this case i'm not going to assume

645
00:22:39.919 --> 00:22:42.799
that the value of vds sat

646
00:22:42.799 --> 00:22:46.000
is equal to v s minus vt

647
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.200
okay so what i'm trying to say is that

648
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.799
whenever the transfer is in saturation

649
00:22:50.799 --> 00:22:53.039
regime the value of vds

650
00:22:53.039 --> 00:22:56.000
is written as vds sat but that value of

651
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
vdsat

652
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.400
need not to be equal to vgs minus vt as

653
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.159
we had it for the long channel device

654
00:23:02.159 --> 00:23:05.120
clear so based on this i want to rewrite

655
00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.159
it

656
00:23:06.159 --> 00:23:08.720
hope you're clear okay so since because

657
00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.400
it doesn't follow the same rule as we

658
00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.600
had before

659
00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.200
i'm going to express the saturation

660
00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.640
current

661
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.120
by two different ways and then i i'm

662
00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.720
going to merge both these expressions

663
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.600
now to get the

664
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.760
final conclusion out of the expression

665
00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:22.720
clear

666
00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.720
so since because the transistor gets

667
00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.320
into the saturation regime the moment

668
00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.640
the value of vds is equal to vdsat

669
00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.960
i want to rewrite the current equation

670
00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.240
in the saturation regime

671
00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.600
just by substituting vds equal to vdsat

672
00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.360
but this video sat need not to be equal

673
00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.280
to v just minus vt okay later i will

674
00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.880
prove that they are not equal but as

675
00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.880
of now this need not to be equal to vgs

676
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.320
minus vt will hold this

677
00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.360
as just vds sat so

678
00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.360
wherever i had my vds i'm going to

679
00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.919
rewrite them with vds sat okay and then

680
00:23:51.919 --> 00:23:53.360
it followed by mu

681
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.559
c yx w by l and then we had v g s

682
00:23:56.559 --> 00:23:59.360
minus vt and then we had something like

683
00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.240
vds

684
00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.240
divided by 2 so that vds has to be

685
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.600
replaced with

686
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:07.360
radius sat by 2

687
00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.320
into v dsi so this is one expression

688
00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:10.880
okay

689
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.640
and there is also one more expression

690
00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.640
which we can derive just by making use

691
00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.159
of the current equation that

692
00:24:16.159 --> 00:24:18.720
however we did for our linear region how

693
00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.000
i can express this current equation in

694
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:20.960
terms of charges

695
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:24.159
it is written as qch divided by the

696
00:24:24.159 --> 00:24:25.440
transit time

697
00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.760
right any of the qch expression reminds

698
00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:28.799
the same doesn't matter

699
00:24:28.799 --> 00:24:30.840
okay so it can be returned as something

700
00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.840
like

701
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.600
okay so this expression reminds the same

702
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.520
okay but what happens

703
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.640
for the transit time is is different

704
00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.080
okay this transit time

705
00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.159
is right now can be expressed in terms

706
00:24:44.159 --> 00:24:47.200
of drift velocity

707
00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.559
but this drift velocity in the

708
00:24:48.559 --> 00:24:50.640
saturation regime is replaced with

709
00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.559
saturation velocity okay so i've

710
00:24:52.559 --> 00:24:54.000
replaced this vd

711
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
with saturation velocity okay so i'm

712
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.360
just going to substitute each of these

713
00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.520
quantities to build up this expression

714
00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.400
here so i would end up having

715
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:06.320
an idea sat to be equal to

716
00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.000
saturation velocity times c yx

717
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.600
and then the width and there is no l

718
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.039
term here because one of the l

719
00:25:13.039 --> 00:25:14.960
gets cancelled with this l okay due to

720
00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.720
which there is no l term that is sitting

721
00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.000
here

722
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.919
and the remaining term of v g s minus v

723
00:25:19.919 --> 00:25:21.200
t

724
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.320
and v d s sat by two would appear here

725
00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.200
okay so i have two different kind

726
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.400
expressions that

727
00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.320
conveys the same current equation that

728
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.240
exists for a transistor

729
00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.600
in the saturation region okay so now

730
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.120
i'm going to utilize both these

731
00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.200
expression like maybe i will write this

732
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.840
as

733
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.000
a and this one as

734
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.240
b okay i'm going to utilize both this

735
00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.200
expression

736
00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.960
in order to derive the total saturation

737
00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.799
current equation

738
00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:53.279
so in order to write this i'm going to

739
00:25:53.279 --> 00:25:54.400
substitute

740
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:58.080
two things that is the kappa of vdsat

741
00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.799
which we had in our equation number a so

742
00:26:00.799 --> 00:26:01.120
this

743
00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.440
term would be replaced with our known

744
00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.240
expression which is written as 1 plus

745
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.760
vds sat by vc

746
00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.320
okay and i'm also going to rewrite this

747
00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.039
vsat

748
00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:14.720
okay so if you want how to get this

749
00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.880
reset i'll first express this ec

750
00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.880
we know that this ec based on the

751
00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.320
continuity equation

752
00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.480
it can be written as something like this

753
00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.320
so it's based on the expression that we

754
00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.840
derived earlier okay

755
00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.919
so if you are following it i think there

756
00:26:27.919 --> 00:26:29.440
won't be any doubt in

757
00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.640
within you okay yeah so this expression

758
00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.679
i have utilized

759
00:26:33.679 --> 00:26:36.799
clear so v sat

760
00:26:36.799 --> 00:26:39.760
equals to mu times e c divided by two

761
00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:40.320
and that

762
00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.840
expression is what is being rewritten

763
00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.679
something like this okay

764
00:26:43.679 --> 00:26:46.799
so again this ec

765
00:26:46.799 --> 00:26:48.640
can be returned in terms of critical

766
00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.159
voltage right

767
00:26:50.159 --> 00:26:53.600
so vc by l because

768
00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.320
for the other side also i have this vc

769
00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.919
so due to which i'm just taking

770
00:26:57.919 --> 00:27:00.000
few things in common so whichever things

771
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
that i can cancel out i can just cancel

772
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:02.720
here

773
00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.799
so due to which i have this v sat

774
00:27:04.799 --> 00:27:06.640
expressed in terms of

775
00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:11.039
vc clear so i have got two expressions

776
00:27:11.039 --> 00:27:12.320
which i am going to substitute

777
00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.400
in both these equation number a as was

778
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.600
equation number b

779
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.520
here so once you have both these

780
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.200
expression you could see that there are

781
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.240
few terms there is a kappa of vds term

782
00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.960
and there is also vsat term or the

783
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.720
velocity saturation term

784
00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.799
so for both these expressions i want to

785
00:27:28.799 --> 00:27:31.360
rewrite them in terms of vc

786
00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.799
okay and those expressions for kappa of

787
00:27:34.799 --> 00:27:35.039
v

788
00:27:35.039 --> 00:27:38.320
sat in terms of v c and the v

789
00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.559
sat in terms of v c is being written

790
00:27:40.559 --> 00:27:42.559
here so now the only thing that i have

791
00:27:42.559 --> 00:27:44.480
to do is that since because both

792
00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.640
expression a as well as expression b are

793
00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.240
conveying the same

794
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.559
current equation i can equate both these

795
00:27:50.559 --> 00:27:52.240
equations

796
00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.200
so now that i am just going to

797
00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.679
substitute each of these quantities and

798
00:27:55.679 --> 00:27:57.679
let me try to first express them and

799
00:27:57.679 --> 00:28:02.000
later i will replace this v sat

800
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.360
maybe i am just equating b

801
00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:17.840
that is equal to a okay

802
00:28:18.559 --> 00:28:20.960
okay so which are the terms that are

803
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:21.919
common i can

804
00:28:21.919 --> 00:28:24.399
actually cancel them yeah i think there

805
00:28:24.399 --> 00:28:25.120
is something that i

806
00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.640
uh yeah so

807
00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.240
this is supposed to be equal to v g s

808
00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.000
minus v t

809
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.960
minus v d sat okay so this is something

810
00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:35.440
that i

811
00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.520
forgot to mention here okay so in the

812
00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.480
previous case uh

813
00:28:40.799 --> 00:28:43.919
i think in the long channel structure we

814
00:28:43.919 --> 00:28:44.240
were

815
00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.640
directly using this minus vds by two

816
00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.600
okay but

817
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.760
in the case of uh saturation regime uh

818
00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:50.880
the channel

819
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.960
is tapered okay so due to which i'm just

820
00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:53.919
using only

821
00:28:53.919 --> 00:28:56.720
vds sat here okay there is no half

822
00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.559
factor that is sitting here here

823
00:28:58.559 --> 00:29:00.880
so sorry for for not informing this

824
00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:01.760
earlier okay

825
00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.080
the reason behind this uh substitution

826
00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.120
is just because

827
00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.559
the channel staffered when we are in the

828
00:29:08.559 --> 00:29:10.640
saturation regime

829
00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.600
and due to which this vds by 2 is being

830
00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:16.080
rewritten as

831
00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:19.279
just vds set clear

832
00:29:19.279 --> 00:29:22.720
and substitute this guy v sat

833
00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:26.399
which is vc by l

834
00:29:26.399 --> 00:29:32.159
and we have something like vgs minus vt

835
00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:37.120
vdsat and this kappa of vds can be

836
00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.039
written as something like 1 plus

837
00:29:39.039 --> 00:29:42.240
vds sat by vc

838
00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.399
and there is also mu by l term that is

839
00:29:44.399 --> 00:29:46.159
sitting here

840
00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:49.600
and then we just minus vt minus

841
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.480
radius sat

842
00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:56.000
into various set okay so again there are

843
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:56.399
few

844
00:29:56.399 --> 00:29:58.240
few common terms which we can cancel

845
00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.240
namely the mobility and the length

846
00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:09.840
can be cancelled

847
00:30:10.799 --> 00:30:13.520
okay so again this vc's can be cancelled

848
00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.520
from here to here

849
00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.520
and the only thing that we need to do is

850
00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.799
just uh some

851
00:30:18.799 --> 00:30:20.880
sort of cross multiplication of these

852
00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.840
two terms

853
00:30:45.279 --> 00:30:48.399
okay so there is quadratic term which we

854
00:30:48.399 --> 00:30:49.520
can actually cancel

855
00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:53.039
on both the sides okay so

856
00:30:53.039 --> 00:30:55.520
there is no caution and we certainly

857
00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.760
have to rearrange this expression

858
00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.039
yeah so certainly there is one

859
00:30:59.039 --> 00:31:01.679
particular term and this term vgs minus

860
00:31:01.679 --> 00:31:02.640
vt

861
00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:05.679
times vds can actually get merged with

862
00:31:05.679 --> 00:31:07.679
this expression or towards the left side

863
00:31:07.679 --> 00:31:09.840
so

864
00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:16.559
you would have v g s minus v t

865
00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:33.840
video sat

866
00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.159
yeah so i'm just going to take off this

867
00:31:42.159 --> 00:31:42.960
video sat

868
00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:47.840
in common

869
00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.840
uh

870
00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.000
now i just want to look into this

871
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
expression of vdsat

872
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.080
so this vdsat is actually proportional

873
00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.279
to vgs minus vt

874
00:32:11.279 --> 00:32:13.279
but there is a factor that sits between

875
00:32:13.279 --> 00:32:14.480
those v d sat

876
00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.720
and the v s minus v d and what is this

877
00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.480
factor

878
00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.200
how i can rewrite this factor this

879
00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.559
factor

880
00:32:22.559 --> 00:32:25.279
is almost similar to the expression of

881
00:32:25.279 --> 00:32:27.519
this kappa that we derived earlier right

882
00:32:27.519 --> 00:32:30.320
because the kappa of v can be returned

883
00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.440
that is that cup of e

884
00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.279
yeah so cup of v has a form that is

885
00:32:33.279 --> 00:32:35.600
written as 1 divided by 1 plus

886
00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.240
v times that of the critical voltage

887
00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:38.640
okay

888
00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.399
so when i look back into this expression

889
00:32:40.399 --> 00:32:41.679
that we derived here

890
00:32:41.679 --> 00:32:44.080
you could see it is 1 upon 1 plus some

891
00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:44.960
voltage

892
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.519
that is as a whole it is v just minus vt

893
00:32:47.519 --> 00:32:48.240
voltage

894
00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.480
divided by the critical voltage so i can

895
00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.320
rewrite this expression that i marked

896
00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.360
with orange

897
00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:57.679
as something like kappa of vgs

898
00:32:57.679 --> 00:33:00.720
minus vt into

899
00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:04.320
vgs minus vt okay

900
00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:08.080
so certainly we know that this

901
00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:11.760
kappa will take up a value that is equal

902
00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:12.559
to one

903
00:33:12.559 --> 00:33:15.039
whenever we deal with so when does this

904
00:33:15.039 --> 00:33:17.919
copper term will take up a value of one

905
00:33:17.919 --> 00:33:21.120
long channel yeah so whenever we deal

906
00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:21.760
with

907
00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:25.279
long channel device okay

908
00:33:25.279 --> 00:33:30.159
or whenever the value of vds

909
00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:34.159
is small but what happens when i have

910
00:33:34.159 --> 00:33:37.519
radius that is large okay a video that

911
00:33:37.519 --> 00:33:38.399
is large

912
00:33:38.399 --> 00:33:40.960
as well as

913
00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.480
the length of the channel is less than

914
00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.039
one micrometer okay

915
00:33:47.039 --> 00:33:49.200
so in that case we know that this kappa

916
00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.640
will take up a value that is smaller

917
00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:51.760
than the value of 1.

918
00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:55.840
so what does it implies to this equation

919
00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.240
which means that my device will enter

920
00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.279
into saturation

921
00:33:59.279 --> 00:34:04.080
well before the vds reaches vgs minus vt

922
00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:07.200
so in the previous case yeah

923
00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:11.599
so for for a longer channel device

924
00:34:11.599 --> 00:34:14.239
the device was entering into saturation

925
00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:14.719
when

926
00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:18.639
the value of vds is exactly equal to vgs

927
00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:19.520
minus v t

928
00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.440
okay so this is for the case of a long

929
00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.760
channel

930
00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:26.719
okay but in in our case what happens is

931
00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:27.119
that

932
00:34:27.119 --> 00:34:29.440
i am entering into the saturation regime

933
00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.560
well before

934
00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.399
reaching the value of v just minus vt at

935
00:34:32.399 --> 00:34:34.480
this point itself

936
00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.560
i'm entering into saturation and i'm

937
00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.760
marking this voltage

938
00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.639
as v d sat and that v d sat can be

939
00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:41.359
written as

940
00:34:41.359 --> 00:34:45.280
kappa of v g s minus v t

941
00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.320
into v g s

942
00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.079
minus vt and we know that this kappa

943
00:34:50.079 --> 00:34:51.599
value will be small right

944
00:34:51.599 --> 00:34:53.199
so due to which i will be entering into

945
00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:54.960
saturation regime before the value of

946
00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:55.520
vds

947
00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:58.240
is equal to vgs minus vt okay and due to

948
00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:58.720
which

949
00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:04.240
the short channel transistor has

950
00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:09.440
extended saturation regime

951
00:35:09.599 --> 00:35:11.520
so what do we mean by this extended

952
00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.640
saturation regime

953
00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:15.200
you see in the long channel device the

954
00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.359
saturation regime falls

955
00:35:17.359 --> 00:35:19.440
right from this value of vds all the way

956
00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.200
through this okay when i take a short

957
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.520
channel

958
00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.160
the saturation regime is much wider for

959
00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.839
a short channel device

960
00:35:28.839 --> 00:35:31.920
okay so this is one of the physical

961
00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:33.440
phenomena that you can observe

962
00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.160
when you try to plot id versus vds okay

963
00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.680
apart from this there is also one more

964
00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.119
important factor that i want to bring

965
00:35:39.119 --> 00:35:39.440
out

966
00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:42.800
okay let us look for the expression b

967
00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.119
so when i look carefully you could see

968
00:35:45.119 --> 00:35:46.720
that the value of this id sat

969
00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:50.079
is proportional to v g s minus v t

970
00:35:50.079 --> 00:35:52.320
okay either you look into the expression

971
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.400
a or you look into the expression b

972
00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.680
you could see that they are proportional

973
00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.839
to v g s minus v t so now

974
00:35:57.839 --> 00:36:00.880
for a short channel device let me pick

975
00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:01.280
this

976
00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:05.280
graphs that i have plotted earlier

977
00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.079
whenever i deal with short channel

978
00:36:10.079 --> 00:36:12.400
device okay let me pick a green one

979
00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.720
what happens is that since the

980
00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.880
saturation current

981
00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.760
is proportional to vgs minus vt how do i

982
00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:20.640
modify this

983
00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:24.000
graph what modification do i need to

984
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.599
have for this particular graph

985
00:36:27.599 --> 00:36:29.520
will i be still following this kind of

986
00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.280
graph or will there be any

987
00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:33.040
differences in the graph apart from the

988
00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.880
device getting into saturation much

989
00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:35.680
earlier

990
00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.359
will there be any other impact that i

991
00:36:37.359 --> 00:36:38.960
can impose on this particular

992
00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:42.880
graph we will have equal width

993
00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:46.079
between the yes true true yeah

994
00:36:46.079 --> 00:36:49.200
exactly so what happens is that we'll

995
00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:49.680
have

996
00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:55.839
equal bits so

997
00:36:56.079 --> 00:36:58.480
so so this is the kind of phenomena that

998
00:36:58.480 --> 00:36:59.920
we would end up having

999
00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.160
once we have a velocity saturation

1000
00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.280
impact okay

1001
00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:06.000
so in a way the current that i would get

1002
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.040
is also small

1003
00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.440
y again i will look back into our

1004
00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:11.040
current equation

1005
00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:13.040
that is equation number a so since the

1006
00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.160
value of kappa

1007
00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:16.400
takes up a value that is less than one

1008
00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.760
the current that i would get out of the

1009
00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:18.400
device

1010
00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.599
will be small okay and the same has been

1011
00:37:21.599 --> 00:37:22.160
reflected

1012
00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.640
even in this graph when i go for equal

1013
00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.000
widths the current

1014
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.240
that i would get is small compared to

1015
00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:29.760
the current that i was getting earlier

1016
00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.119
for the same

1017
00:37:31.119 --> 00:37:34.240
value of vgs okay so there are two three

1018
00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:36.720
factors that we can see here

1019
00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:40.800
the first factor is the device

1020
00:37:41.839 --> 00:37:46.240
enters into saturation

1021
00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:51.440
much earlier

1022
00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:55.119
okay the second one the ids

1023
00:37:55.119 --> 00:37:58.640
is linearly equal to v just minus vt

1024
00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.800
and due to which i would end up having

1025
00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:05.200
equal widths

1026
00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:08.400
of id sat okay

1027
00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.640
for

1028
00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.720
equal widths of

1029
00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:18.880
vgs minus vt values okay or vgs values

1030
00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.480
or equal bits of vgs values

1031
00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.720
clear so this is the second thing that i

1032
00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.599
can see

1033
00:38:23.599 --> 00:38:26.240
and also the current that i would get

1034
00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.560
the idsat

1035
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:31.520
would be small

1036
00:38:31.599 --> 00:38:35.040
for short channel

1037
00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.560
device okay so these are the three

1038
00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.640
physical phenomena that i can observe

1039
00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.960
okay so now there is one last thing that

1040
00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.880
i want to show here

1041
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.200
we have plotted id versus vds graph how

1042
00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:48.560
about id versus vgs graph

1043
00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.680
any idea let me use the

1044
00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.240
same graph that i plotted earlier yeah

1045
00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.720
how does this graph would change

1046
00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.920
where is my saturation regime your own

1047
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:02.400
saturation would be linear instead of

1048
00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:05.040
quadratic

1049
00:39:05.599 --> 00:39:08.160
yes yes so yeah instead of quadratic

1050
00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.599
what happens is that it will be a kind

1051
00:39:09.599 --> 00:39:10.320
of linear

1052
00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:13.520
okay but at small values of uh vgs minus

1053
00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.000
vt

1054
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.040
it will be still quadratic okay because

1055
00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:20.079
the current ids

1056
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.280
has an expression copper of vgs minus vt

1057
00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.000
okay

1058
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.160
so when this value of vgs minus vt is

1059
00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:27.119
small

1060
00:39:27.119 --> 00:39:29.200
what does it mean the kappa will take up

1061
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.320
a value of 1

1062
00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:33.839
when i try to plot this small portion

1063
00:39:33.839 --> 00:39:34.480
will reflect

1064
00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.560
a quadratic relation but once i cross a

1065
00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:37.839
particular value

1066
00:39:37.839 --> 00:39:40.079
it becomes a kind of straight line like

1067
00:39:40.079 --> 00:39:41.359
a kind of linear

1068
00:39:41.359 --> 00:39:45.040
graph okay it becomes something like a

1069
00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:46.560
straight line

1070
00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:48.800
even in the saturation regime it becomes

1071
00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.720
a linear relation between regions and

1072
00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:53.119
id here there won't be any any curvature

1073
00:39:53.119 --> 00:39:54.000
here

1074
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.200
but initially there will be a small

1075
00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.040
curvature just because the kappa

1076
00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.640
would take up the value of one when the

1077
00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.480
value of v g s minus v d is small

1078
00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.920
clear but otherwise it takes up a linear

1079
00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:04.480
relation

1080
00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.880
here and then you end up having a very

1081
00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.440
less current

1082
00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.440
after this okay so these are the

1083
00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.560
pictures that i've drawn

1084
00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:15.599
which i know that uh it is not that

1085
00:40:15.599 --> 00:40:19.200
great so i'll show you the pictures

1086
00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:22.160
that are taken from the textbook okay

1087
00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:22.480
yeah

1088
00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.079
so this is a kind of carrot for a long

1089
00:40:24.079 --> 00:40:25.680
channel towards the left side and this

1090
00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.200
is the cara that i would get for a short

1091
00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:27.680
channel

1092
00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:30.000
of equal bits and also the device is

1093
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:30.880
entering into

1094
00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:34.240
saturation much earlier

1095
00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.680
and this is the quadratic relation that

1096
00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.760
i have for a long channel

1097
00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:40.240
and this is a kind of linear relation

1098
00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.520
that i have for the

1099
00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.760
short channel device okay so hope that

1100
00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.359
you have understood how does the

1101
00:40:45.359 --> 00:40:47.280
saturation impacts our id

1102
00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.880
characteristics as a whole

1103
00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.720
okay so in the next class we will

1104
00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:52.079
discuss about the mobility

1105
00:40:52.079 --> 00:40:54.400
degradation which we will not discuss

1106
00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.440
too much we'll just

1107
00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:58.079
tell what is this mobility degradation

1108
00:40:58.079 --> 00:40:59.920
means and how does it impacts our

1109
00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.440
current that's it okay we will not go

1110
00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:01.839
into

1111
00:41:01.839 --> 00:41:03.599
expressions or derivations or something

1112
00:41:03.599 --> 00:41:05.280
like that we just uh

1113
00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.359
look into it and then we'll just move on

1114
00:41:07.359 --> 00:41:09.280
to the further on ideal effects

1115
00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:19.280
here so let me stop here
