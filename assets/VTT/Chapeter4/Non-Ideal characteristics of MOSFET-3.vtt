WEBVTT

1
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.719
so your mic is

2
00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.679
new yes

3
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.640
okay uh sorry for that yeah

4
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.320
so what i was talking is about the

5
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.840
velocity saturation effect this is one

6
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.880
among the effect

7
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.800
that we have under the uh secondary

8
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.080
effects and

9
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.320
the saturation effect is something like

10
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.679
when the electric field between the

11
00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:30.000
source

12
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.479
and the drain attains a particular

13
00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:33.680
electric field which we call it as a

14
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.040
critical electric field the velocity of

15
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.960
the carrier becomes saturated

16
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.320
so due to which there are a few things

17
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.920
that happens to our device

18
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.120
iv characteristic graphs okay one of the

19
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.719
major thing is that our device will

20
00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:49.200
enter into saturation regime well before

21
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.000
the value of vds is equal to vgs minus

22
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.039
vt okay

23
00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.960
because in the long channel device we

24
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.399
always assume that the transistor

25
00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.480
enters into saturation regime the moment

26
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.640
the value of vds is equal to vgs minus

27
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.280
vt

28
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.600
okay so that was something a kind of a

29
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.720
well defined

30
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.119
voltage by which i can get to know

31
00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.439
whether my device is in saturation or

32
00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.920
i'm in the linear region okay but right

33
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.159
now when we use a small channel device

34
00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.159
what happens is that uh this

35
00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.240
phenomenon never follows like uh we

36
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.520
can't completely define that

37
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.759
our device enters into saturation the

38
00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.000
moment the vds is equal to vgs minus vt

39
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.560
but in short the device enters into

40
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.439
saturation

41
00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.920
for value of vds that is even smaller

42
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.600
than the value of v just minus vt okay

43
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.200
so due to which what happens is that we

44
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.400
have an extended

45
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.799
saturation regime and the second

46
00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.240
physical phenomena that happens is that

47
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.439
the saturation current

48
00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.000
is proportional to vgs minus vt okay so

49
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.040
this is something

50
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.040
uh which is different from than compared

51
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.240
to our uh previous

52
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.560
characteristic graphs okay where the

53
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.680
saturation current

54
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.960
for a long channel device was

55
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.799
proportional to v just minus v the whole

56
00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.159
square but right now

57
00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.439
it is proportional okay so due to which

58
00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:58.960
there is an equal width

59
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.640
when there is an equal increment in the

60
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.079
value of vgs

61
00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.159
okay so this is something that we had

62
00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.520
addressed in the previous

63
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.878
class and uh also because

64
00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:12.000
the id sat is a function of

65
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.680
kappa of uh vds

66
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.239
yeah so here is this okay so since

67
00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:18.800
because

68
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.080
the idsat is basically a function of vds

69
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.640
what happens is that the current that we

70
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.760
would get

71
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.080
for a short channel a value of vds which

72
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.360
is larger

73
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.040
the copper value we always know that it

74
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.400
will be less than the value of one

75
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.840
due to which the current also gets

76
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.360
reduced okay so these are some of the

77
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.720
physical phenomena that we were

78
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.800
addressing in the previous class and

79
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.640
today i just want to show you about this

80
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.400
characteristic graph plot okay so i just

81
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.280
want to plot this id versus vds graph

82
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.239
through simulation and also if possible

83
00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.080
i will try to plot id versus vgs

84
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.400
okay this simulation is just a way to

85
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.239
explain the things okay so

86
00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.640
it's not a part of your theory course

87
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.319
but it's part of your lab

88
00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.519
i guess right now you could see the

89
00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.080
screen right

90
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.400
a different screen yeah

91
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.560
yes so there are a few setups that i

92
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:19.840
have to do just just grab for some time

93
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.760
so these things you will be learning

94
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.000
later later on during the course

95
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.720
okay so i'm just

96
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.959
trying to show only the graph part of it

97
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.799
so you don't need to worry right now

98
00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:47.840
about why i am setting all these things

99
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.239
so now that i am just going to plot id

100
00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.640
versus

101
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.920
vds graph okay and

102
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.080
the value of vgs that it has taken is

103
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.280
0.6 okay so

104
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.080
i have just defined those as a variable

105
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.040
and

106
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.879
right now we are varying the value of

107
00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.560
various right from 0 to

108
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.799
1.2 volt and i've kept the value of

109
00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.279
wages to be around

110
00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.680
0.6 volt okay yeah so this was the

111
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.720
carrot that we have

112
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.759
and i also wanted to plot for

113
00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.639
different values of vgs okay not just

114
00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.880
for 0.6 i want i just want it for

115
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.639
different values of vgs so what i do is

116
00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.199
i have to perform something known as

117
00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:37.040
parametric analysis and

118
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.759
i'll just pull out my vgs and i would

119
00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.080
vary the value of vgs from 0 to

120
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.240
1.2 maybe

121
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.320
6

122
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.600
[Applause]

123
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.000
okay so these are some of the keras and

124
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.199
as you could

125
00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.280
clearly see that there is some sort of

126
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.639
quadratic nature

127
00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.520
when the value of vgs even even it's a

128
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.360
function of regions as well okay

129
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.080
so but as you move on the spacing that

130
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.360
we have between these two

131
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.280
lines maybe uh i'll change the

132
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.960
background okay

133
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.560
yeah so again there is something known

134
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.400
as uh mobility degradation which happens

135
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.000
because of the vertical electric field

136
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.360
that is created between the

137
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.560
gate and the body okay so

138
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.880
again it's it's a function of both the

139
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.759
mobility

140
00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:29.520
so in this case you could see that the

141
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.280
the spacing that i have here

142
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.360
is as similar to what we have here so

143
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.120
maybe i have to do a lot

144
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.280
a number of let me just try to

145
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.080
step this one

146
00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:45.120
and let me specify the step size that's

147
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.240
point one okay

148
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.720
so i'm just incrementing the value of

149
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.600
vgs in steps of 100 millivolt

150
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.319
yeah so i hope that right now the graphs

151
00:05:58.319 --> 00:05:59.360
are clear to you

152
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.199
you could see that the spacings that you

153
00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:02.639
have is almost like

154
00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:04.800
a kind of equal spacings when i try to

155
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.639
increase the value of wedges in steps of

156
00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:08.560
100 millivolt

157
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.520
is the graphs are clear

158
00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:15.039
but for low values of vgs obviously

159
00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:16.560
it follows some sort of quadratic

160
00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.960
relation okay but as you rise the value

161
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.000
of v g s

162
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.680
then again what we have is something

163
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.000
known as mobility degradation there is

164
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.080
again one more effect okay that i will

165
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.280
be discussing now

166
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.120
but this is what happens when we try to

167
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.360
plot it okay so we have equal spacings

168
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.600
in the kind of saturation current okay

169
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.720
and there is no

170
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.120
appropriate region where i can visually

171
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.919
see

172
00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:40.080
the linear region separated out of our

173
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.680
saturation regime okay it's almost like

174
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.199
a kind of linear

175
00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:45.840
graph okay so so something like a kind

176
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.720
of

177
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.680
a smooth graph that happens here okay so

178
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.520
it becomes very hard for us to actually

179
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.039
define whether the transfer is in

180
00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:55.440
saturation or in the linear region

181
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.800
so this is for chart channel transistor

182
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.360
yeah yeah this is for 45 nanometer okay

183
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.960
the length and the width of the channels

184
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:03.280
are

185
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.199
specified here okay so here in this case

186
00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:08.160
the length of the channel

187
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.039
was 45 nanometer okay now we can

188
00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:11.840
actually mimic

189
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.720
but it's not a real device but what i

190
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.440
can do is that

191
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.080
i can just make this as something like 1

192
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.639
micrometer 1u means 1 micrometer

193
00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:22.960
and i would increase the width to say

194
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.160
for example 10

195
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.360
micrometer okay and there will be a

196
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.720
slight change because the thickness of

197
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.720
the oxide reminds the same for 45

198
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.400
nanometer technology okay so due to

199
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.919
which there will be some sort of

200
00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:36.479
mobility degradation effect we can't

201
00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:37.360
really model

202
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.919
a long-term device just by changing the

203
00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:41.120
length and the width of the

204
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.360
transistors but still we can certainly

205
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.800
see some sort of changes that is

206
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.840
happening

207
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.840
uh

208
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.639
i just make this as one micro micron as

209
00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:25.680
the channel length

210
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.479
and 10 micron as the width of the uh

211
00:08:28.479 --> 00:08:29.360
transistor

212
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.440
of the channel and let me

213
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:41.839
just get back to parametric

214
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.120
so again we are not entirely changing

215
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.200
the technology we are reusing the 45

216
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.279
nanometer technology itself but

217
00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:51.200
with higher length and rate okay so

218
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.480
certainly there will be some sort of

219
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.519
differences

220
00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:55.760
but you cannot expect some sort of

221
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.360
quadratic nature that i was showing

222
00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.680
earlier okay so we have to use the real

223
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.200
technology for it in order to get the

224
00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:06.560
effect okay yeah so the one

225
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.120
towards the right okay so this is

226
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:09.600
something

227
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.560
for a kind of longer channel okay and

228
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.399
the one towards the left side is for the

229
00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:15.760
shorter channel okay so you could

230
00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.200
barely see that there is a kind of

231
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.200
spacing becomes higher and higher

232
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.279
okay whereas the spacings here are

233
00:09:21.279 --> 00:09:23.360
almost equal whereas here there is

234
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.440
some sort of impact that you could see

235
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.720
okay i guess uh

236
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.480
more than this we can't uh really talk

237
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.800
about this just with 45 nanometer i have

238
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.240
to use a completely different technology

239
00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.519
to talk about it okay

240
00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:36.640
so that whatever we study in the theory

241
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.720
with quadratic spacing you can really

242
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.640
see those quadratic spacing only for

243
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.160
technologies which are at least a

244
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.160
minimum of 500 nanometer or more than

245
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.440
that okay one micron

246
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.279
technology if we have then those

247
00:09:47.279 --> 00:09:48.720
technologies can be utilized

248
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.240
and we can do the simulation in order to

249
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.880
get the characteristics that we see

250
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.040
normally in our textbooks okay this is

251
00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.800
just to show how the graphs have been

252
00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.600
brought in and

253
00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.600
and you could also see that the

254
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.640
saturation

255
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.079
region barely happens for a value of vds

256
00:10:04.079 --> 00:10:05.839
that is more than a certain value okay

257
00:10:05.839 --> 00:10:07.279
whereas in this case you could see that

258
00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:09.279
the device almost enters into saturation

259
00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:10.000
regime

260
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.200
for even for small values of videos yeah

261
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.920
so now i'll just switch over my screen

262
00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:16.959
so the next

263
00:10:16.959 --> 00:10:18.959
type of impact that i wanted to discuss

264
00:10:18.959 --> 00:10:22.560
is about mobility degradation

265
00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.680
now we have already seen something known

266
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.279
as velocity saturation effect

267
00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:28.880
and that velocity saturation effect

268
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.880
happens because of the lateral electric

269
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.320
field that is the field that exists

270
00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.760
between the source

271
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.320
and the drain okay but on the other hand

272
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.000
what we have

273
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.959
is a field due to the gate as well okay

274
00:10:40.959 --> 00:10:41.760
because

275
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.200
we know that the gate certainly has some

276
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.720
sort of potential

277
00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.200
which is greater than the value of vt

278
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.079
okay so

279
00:10:50.079 --> 00:10:51.680
so this will actually create some sort

280
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.279
of field across the oxide okay

281
00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:55.120
across the thickness of the oxide we

282
00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.959
have some sort of electric field

283
00:10:56.959 --> 00:10:58.480
okay which is a constant electric field

284
00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.839
that we have studied when we discussed

285
00:10:59.839 --> 00:11:00.399
about the

286
00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:04.480
cv right yeah now even this field will

287
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.920
create some sort of impact

288
00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.399
now what we wanted is the free carriers

289
00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:09.120
let me just

290
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.640
choose a an nmos so that i have a p type

291
00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.320
as my semiconductor and

292
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.240
once the value of vgs is greater than

293
00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.240
the value of vt we know that

294
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.760
it pulls out all the electrons and it

295
00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.160
creates some sort of channel here okay

296
00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:24.959
and then we

297
00:11:24.959 --> 00:11:26.640
also know that we have some sort of

298
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.000
repeated uh

299
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.120
region around this entire segment okay

300
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.079
yeah so now what happens is that these

301
00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:35.279
electrons

302
00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:37.920
uh has to move from the source side

303
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.200
towards the drain side

304
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.279
okay and this is our entity operation

305
00:11:41.279 --> 00:11:42.480
but what happens

306
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.160
on the other hand is that the value of

307
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.680
vgs

308
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.680
creates an electric field which we call

309
00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.279
as a vertical electric field

310
00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:51.360
which is given as vg by the thickness of

311
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.480
the oxide

312
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.519
okay so now as the technology shrinks

313
00:11:55.519 --> 00:11:56.000
down

314
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
the thickness of the oxide becomes less

315
00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.360
than nanometer okay

316
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.760
i think at the atomic scale you will

317
00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.839
find this thickness of the oxide okay

318
00:12:03.839 --> 00:12:06.480
so this in turn creates some sort of

319
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.320
huge electric field even for small

320
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.240
values of vgs

321
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.480
and that creates a very high electric

322
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.000
field and due to which

323
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.639
one could actually model the mobility of

324
00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:17.680
the carrier

325
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.000
that is effectively being disturbed by

326
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.160
this vertical electric field

327
00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.079
as something like mu naught when there

328
00:12:24.079 --> 00:12:26.240
is no field that causes the uh

329
00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.760
motion due to the vertical field

330
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.200
and then there is some sort of eta

331
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.200
factor okay uh this is something like a

332
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:33.920
kind of uh

333
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.040
empirical factor multiplied by the vgs

334
00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.480
minus vt okay

335
00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.720
so as we raise the value of this radius

336
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.600
minus vt

337
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.880
effectively what happens is that the

338
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.120
mobility of your carrier

339
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.839
becomes slow okay now this can be again

340
00:12:47.839 --> 00:12:50.000
can be shown some sort of

341
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.600
with a comical video okay

342
00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.360
as something like this okay

343
00:12:57.839 --> 00:12:59.839
so this is the kind of reporter who just

344
00:12:59.839 --> 00:13:01.760
wants to report something and uh he is

345
00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.399
trying to

346
00:13:02.399 --> 00:13:05.680
put himself stand against the strong

347
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.480
wind okay but he couldn't be able to

348
00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.040
resist

349
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.240
so what happens is that he couldn't be

350
00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.320
able to move uh between the source and

351
00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.680
the drain because of the

352
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.279
high uh vertical field towards the storm

353
00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:19.680
okay that flows okay so that makes him

354
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.480
to collide

355
00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.279
along the uh wall okay so it is

356
00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:25.920
something like you

357
00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.160
okay let me stop this video okay so you

358
00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.440
got some sort of an idea

359
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.399
okay so with this idea let me try to

360
00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:34.560
mimic this cartoon

361
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:39.440
okay so you have some sort of wall

362
00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:44.480
okay and you you want to run between the

363
00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.560
source side towards the drain side and

364
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.399
you want to have something like this

365
00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:49.680
but what happens is that there is a

366
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.199
vertical field that is coming from the

367
00:13:51.199 --> 00:13:52.079
other side

368
00:13:52.079 --> 00:13:54.320
uh something like a kind of blower a big

369
00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.360
fan okay

370
00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.880
okay so you have to assume that this is

371
00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.399
a fan okay so there is

372
00:13:58.399 --> 00:14:01.600
no other way and this pan is actually

373
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.639
growing at a very high speed okay so

374
00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:06.079
so due to which what happens is that

375
00:14:06.079 --> 00:14:08.320
this person his original

376
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.399
speed would be much larger but just

377
00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:11.680
because of this blow

378
00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.760
his speed would be reduced and in

379
00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.680
general what happens is that he collides

380
00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.600
at the interface between oxide and the

381
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.680
semiconductor okay rather than he tries

382
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:20.800
to move freely

383
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.680
he's been hitted on this interface so it

384
00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.519
is something like you are trying to run

385
00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:27.279
close to the wall so what happens is

386
00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:29.440
that the speed at which you want to

387
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.839
actually get slow down okay rather than

388
00:14:31.839 --> 00:14:33.600
running in a very uh free space you are

389
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.120
trying to run in a very

390
00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.720
cumbersome area so due to which you

391
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.240
cannot run fast okay

392
00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.160
and this is the type of impact that we

393
00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.839
call that impact as a mobility

394
00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:44.160
degradation this happens because of the

395
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.800
vertical field created by this gate

396
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.320
potential

397
00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.920
okay so after this what we have is

398
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.639
something known as channel length

399
00:14:54.639 --> 00:14:55.279
modulation

400
00:14:55.279 --> 00:14:56.480
we have already discussed about this

401
00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.880
channel modulation effect in the last

402
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.199
couple of classes i'll just revise okay

403
00:15:01.199 --> 00:15:04.160
i'll not do the derivation here

404
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.399
now under this channel and modulation

405
00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:07.680
i'm just going to assume that the length

406
00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.920
of the channel is quite high okay so

407
00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.399
in the sense of we are talking about a

408
00:15:12.399 --> 00:15:13.920
saturation current

409
00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.720
for a long channel device okay so we

410
00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.399
know that that could be written as

411
00:15:18.399 --> 00:15:21.440
ids saturation and

412
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.079
that could be written as half k n dash w

413
00:15:24.079 --> 00:15:25.440
by l

414
00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.639
v g s minus v t the whole square and

415
00:15:28.639 --> 00:15:30.160
effectively what happens is that the

416
00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.000
length of the channel is

417
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.920
becoming tapper and tapper as we rise

418
00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.519
the value of vds okay

419
00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:37.600
so this is the channel that i'm trying

420
00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.959
to mark here okay

421
00:15:38.959 --> 00:15:42.160
so this is my channel area where i have

422
00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:42.800
filled with

423
00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.600
all charge carriers within this zone

424
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.320
okay

425
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.560
and this happens when we have vds that

426
00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.079
is equal to vds

427
00:15:50.079 --> 00:15:52.480
sat okay and as we rise the value of

428
00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.519
this vds

429
00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:55.360
beyond the value of vdsat say for

430
00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.839
example i am talking about vds1

431
00:15:57.839 --> 00:16:00.320
which is greater than the value of vdsat

432
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.000
what happens is that this channel

433
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.360
is actually getting tappered further

434
00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.600
and effectively the length of the

435
00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.040
channel has got reduced

436
00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.079
where i have filled with carriers okay

437
00:16:12.079 --> 00:16:15.120
so this region is currently been filled

438
00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.079
with carriers

439
00:16:16.079 --> 00:16:18.160
but there is a region where i don't have

440
00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.519
any carriers here okay so this

441
00:16:19.519 --> 00:16:20.560
particular region is

442
00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.959
known is left over with no carriers here

443
00:16:22.959 --> 00:16:23.600
okay

444
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.839
so the effective length across which i

445
00:16:25.839 --> 00:16:27.120
have carriers

446
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.639
has become something like del l

447
00:16:30.639 --> 00:16:32.079
and this is my total length of the

448
00:16:32.079 --> 00:16:34.399
channel

449
00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:40.320
okay and effectively what i have here

450
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.759
is the l minus del l okay

451
00:16:43.759 --> 00:16:45.519
and because of this uh we derived and

452
00:16:45.519 --> 00:16:47.360
showed that it could be written as half

453
00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.079
k n dash

454
00:16:48.079 --> 00:16:51.440
w by l into v g s

455
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.880
minus v t the whole square into 1 plus

456
00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:58.240
lambda if we really see this delta l

457
00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.600
is actually proportional to delta v d s

458
00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.359
so this delta v d s is nothing but

459
00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:08.640
it's a voltage that goes beyond the vds

460
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.959
side

461
00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:16.160
so i could write my vds as a potential

462
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.119
that is offsetted by this vdsat plus any

463
00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:21.760
extra potential that i am giving

464
00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.919
can be returned as delta v ds okay so

465
00:17:23.919 --> 00:17:25.599
what happens is that uh we were trying

466
00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:26.240
to

467
00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.240
use this relation and then later we

468
00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.600
wrote this delta l

469
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.480
to be equal to delta vds but we

470
00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.120
introduced

471
00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.280
a constant which we called as lambda

472
00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.720
prime okay

473
00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:40.480
and later on we also introduced one more

474
00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.840
constant which was written as something

475
00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:44.720
like

476
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.000
and due know which one could write

477
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.320
something like delta

478
00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.039
vds okay so now what happens is that

479
00:17:51.039 --> 00:17:52.320
this is a kind of cara

480
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.160
where i'm trying to plot with respect to

481
00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.760
delta vds

482
00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.200
so when you try to plot

483
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.559
the saturation current id is

484
00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:05.679
okay in terms of delta vds

485
00:18:05.679 --> 00:18:08.080
now for a value of delta vds that is

486
00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:08.799
equal to 0

487
00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:10.880
we know that we have some sort of

488
00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.240
saturation current and that could be

489
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.320
defined only by this particular quantity

490
00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:14.720
okay

491
00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.280
so this quantity let us assume some

492
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.080
value for it

493
00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.400
and along the y axis it has some value

494
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.480
now as i raise the value of delta v ds

495
00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.320
what happens is that the lambda gets

496
00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.679
multiplied with the increase in the

497
00:18:25.679 --> 00:18:27.200
value of this delta v ds and due to

498
00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.799
which the graph would normally look

499
00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:30.720
something like a kind of tapered line

500
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.240
okay now

501
00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.840
we don't want this camera to be plotted

502
00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.400
along the axis where i have delta vds

503
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.000
but what i wanted is a plot

504
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.039
of ideas

505
00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:45.760
versus vds okay i wanted a plot that's

506
00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.880
supposed to be

507
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.120
uh running across the value of vds

508
00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.360
rather than the value of delta vds okay

509
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.440
and due to which i need to translate

510
00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.280
each and every point that i have here

511
00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.360
on to this particular plot now in order

512
00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.360
to translate from here to here

513
00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.840
i have to make use of this equation

514
00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.400
where

515
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.880
v d s is nothing but it is defined as

516
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.240
delta v d s

517
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.600
plus v d sat

518
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.520
which i wrote it at the beginning so the

519
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.960
zero point that i have here

520
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.200
when the value of vds delta vds was at

521
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.120
zero i had this particular point

522
00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.039
and this point has to be mapped onto

523
00:19:19.039 --> 00:19:20.320
this graph right

524
00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.840
so when you try to plug in the value of

525
00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.480
this maybe i'll use a different color

526
00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.799
okay so this point i want to plot it

527
00:19:26.799 --> 00:19:27.840
over this

528
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.760
vds graph then what i do is that i just

529
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.280
plug in the value of 0

530
00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.080
that i have here over here so now what

531
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.320
happens is that

532
00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:39.120
for this current value our vds supposed

533
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.559
to be equal to vds

534
00:19:40.559 --> 00:19:42.240
sat so which means that this particular

535
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:46.000
point is actually mapping on to

536
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.080
this particular point where the value of

537
00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.919
vds is equal to

538
00:19:49.919 --> 00:19:53.520
vds sat okay now this point

539
00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.760
again you try to plug in the value that

540
00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:56.880
you have here

541
00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.039
okay this value let us assume that it is

542
00:19:59.039 --> 00:19:59.919
delta v d s

543
00:19:59.919 --> 00:20:02.480
one so that delta v s one you would plug

544
00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:02.960
in here

545
00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.039
and due to which the same similar point

546
00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:06.480
would be marked over here so

547
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.960
when you try to join all of these points

548
00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.880
the same color would be translated

549
00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.679
on this particular camera okay and to

550
00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:16.000
define this current

551
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.320
i want to rewrite this saturation

552
00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.679
current okay

553
00:20:19.679 --> 00:20:22.240
so how will i rewrite this i have to

554
00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.039
change this

555
00:20:23.039 --> 00:20:27.440
delta vds in terms of this vds okay

556
00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.559
so my saturation current that i normally

557
00:20:30.559 --> 00:20:31.039
use

558
00:20:31.039 --> 00:20:34.880
to plot it against ideas versus vds

559
00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.880
can be rewritten as something like half

560
00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.480
k n dash w by

561
00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:42.000
l v g s minus v t the whole square

562
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.320
plus in order to plot on the axis of v d

563
00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.400
s i have to write it as lambda times the

564
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.600
rough vds

565
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.840
clear i i think there was some sort of

566
00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.600
discussion around this particular point

567
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.840
and this is what i was about to define

568
00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.280
uh when you were asking about this

569
00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.720
particular doubt okay so i want to

570
00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.559
translate on different graph okay and

571
00:20:58.559 --> 00:20:59.360
due to which

572
00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.919
this delta vds has to be replaced with

573
00:21:01.919 --> 00:21:03.679
vds so that i can utilize

574
00:21:03.679 --> 00:21:06.400
in the graph that i was trying to plot

575
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.000
uh id versus vds

576
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.600
here yeah so

577
00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.280
after this we have but this

578
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.360
expression is valid only after vds set

579
00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.039
yeah yeah of course

580
00:21:19.039 --> 00:21:20.960
but we also know that when the value of

581
00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.640
vds is less than

582
00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.520
vds sat i will not use this current

583
00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.080
equation

584
00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.080
i will be using the linear current

585
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.679
equation

586
00:21:29.679 --> 00:21:32.400
okay which is defined as gained so i'll

587
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:32.799
be

588
00:21:32.799 --> 00:21:34.559
using that in order to plot the

589
00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:37.520
remaining part of the graph

590
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.520
so now let us talk about the other

591
00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.960
phenomenon that we have is

592
00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.720
about the body effect okay so probably

593
00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.159
you might be already familiar with this

594
00:21:46.159 --> 00:21:47.679
body effect

595
00:21:47.679 --> 00:21:49.520
now this is a kind of physical phenomena

596
00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.360
that happens whenever the source

597
00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.159
and the body are at completely different

598
00:21:54.159 --> 00:21:55.200
potentials okay

599
00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.919
so what i really mean is that the if

600
00:21:57.919 --> 00:21:59.600
there exists a potential difference

601
00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.280
between the source and the body which is

602
00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.919
not equal to zero okay

603
00:22:03.919 --> 00:22:05.360
so this condition means that there is a

604
00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.559
potential difference between the source

605
00:22:06.559 --> 00:22:07.360
and the body

606
00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.640
so in turn you would have studied that

607
00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.080
the threshold voltage of

608
00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.240
a transistor would then get modified and

609
00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.159
that is written as vt naught

610
00:22:16.159 --> 00:22:19.520
plus something like gamma square root of

611
00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.200
2 phi f plus vsb

612
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.960
minus square root of 2 phi f okay

613
00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.960
now this 2 for i f is basically is a

614
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.320
quantity that

615
00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.000
comes through some sort of built in

616
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.919
potential phenomena okay so

617
00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:35.600
sometimes what happens is that they tend

618
00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.039
to write it as

619
00:22:37.039 --> 00:22:39.679
pi s and that is nothing but equals to 2

620
00:22:39.679 --> 00:22:40.159
phi f

621
00:22:40.159 --> 00:22:41.919
okay so only thing that you need to note

622
00:22:41.919 --> 00:22:43.679
here is that any value

623
00:22:43.679 --> 00:22:46.080
either it is given in terms of phi f or

624
00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.760
phi s do not get confused look at the

625
00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.480
value

626
00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.080
if the value is around point seven to

627
00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.559
point eight use that value

628
00:22:52.559 --> 00:22:56.000
either as two phi f or phi is okay so

629
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.440
the only thing that you have to be

630
00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.360
concerned is look for this particular

631
00:22:59.360 --> 00:22:59.919
value

632
00:22:59.919 --> 00:23:02.320
if it is within that range use it in

633
00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.120
case

634
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.919
if the value is given as point four or

635
00:23:05.919 --> 00:23:06.720
point

636
00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.280
three eight okay then you have to

637
00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.960
multiply by a factor of two in order to

638
00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:11.520
get the

639
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.400
so then then this means we what we have

640
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:14.799
given

641
00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:16.720
is something known as phi f and you need

642
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.480
to multiply that quantity in terms of

643
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.320
two in order to get the

644
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.640
highest quantity okay i hope that i am

645
00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.400
not confusing you so i'll just rewrite

646
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:24.720
this

647
00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.640
same expression in terms of phi s so

648
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.480
that both the expressions are conveying

649
00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.559
the same thing the way that i would

650
00:23:30.559 --> 00:23:33.200
look at both these expression is by

651
00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.039
looking at the value that has been given

652
00:23:35.039 --> 00:23:36.320
for this phi s or phi

653
00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:39.440
f here if the value is fit within this

654
00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.640
point seven to point eight

655
00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.039
then use that value as it is over here

656
00:23:43.039 --> 00:23:44.720
okay so here

657
00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.000
maybe i should have used it

658
00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.000
okay so ensure that whatever the value

659
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:52.880
that you're plugging

660
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.480
is in the range between point seven to

661
00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.559
point eight or even point nine it's fine

662
00:23:56.559 --> 00:23:57.120
okay

663
00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.360
so if that is the case you use it as it

664
00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.240
is else

665
00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.240
if the value is given as point four you

666
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.240
multiply by a factor of two and then

667
00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:04.960
plug in that

668
00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.440
particular value over here okay so that

669
00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.720
is nothing but it's a it's a kind of

670
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.760
threshold voltage

671
00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.159
of your diode okay across the pn

672
00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:13.600
junction that we have

673
00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.080
for the between the so body and the

674
00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:17.919
source region okay so there is always a

675
00:24:17.919 --> 00:24:18.960
pn junction

676
00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.799
will not go much in depth about the

677
00:24:20.799 --> 00:24:22.720
physics behind it but the point is that

678
00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.320
uh you look for the range of value that

679
00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.240
is given in your question and

680
00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.360
use that value accordingly okay yeah but

681
00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.240
does this really make sense like i felt

682
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.440
really uh

683
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.200
not good when i just looked at this

684
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.960
expression as it is okay so

685
00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.400
what i have done is that i've just tried

686
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.080
to create some sort of picture here

687
00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.960
okay so before i talk about this picture

688
00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.799
i just want to emphasize about the

689
00:24:44.799 --> 00:24:46.400
what do we really mean by the threshold

690
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.480
voltage okay the real meaning behind the

691
00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.320
threshold voltage

692
00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.919
now a threshold voltage can be

693
00:24:51.919 --> 00:24:54.960
decomposed that voltage of 0.7 or 0.5

694
00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.480
whatever the voltage that we have for a

695
00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:56.880
mass

696
00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.640
transfer can be decomposed into two

697
00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.320
components okay we are part of the

698
00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.919
threshold voltage

699
00:25:01.919 --> 00:25:04.720
let me take this as point six okay just

700
00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.120
a

701
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.600
kind of number so a part of this point

702
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.480
six voltage

703
00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.880
say for example point four volt okay is

704
00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:11.679
meant to

705
00:25:11.679 --> 00:25:16.799
create depletion region first okay

706
00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.960
basically the entire voltage is supposed

707
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.120
to be used for creating the depletion

708
00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:21.679
voltage

709
00:25:21.679 --> 00:25:24.880
maybe i would use that term as well and

710
00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.039
a slight bit of voltage is required okay

711
00:25:27.039 --> 00:25:28.559
so maybe around point

712
00:25:28.559 --> 00:25:31.600
five nine volt i would use

713
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.240
and the remaining voltage that we have

714
00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.720
could be used

715
00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:42.159
to create a thin layer of channel okay

716
00:25:42.159 --> 00:25:43.840
now these are numbers just the numbers

717
00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.320
do not fix your mind to these numbers as

718
00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.120
it is okay

719
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.200
because uh sometimes we always tell when

720
00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.400
the value of v gs

721
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.440
is equal to vt still the transfer is off

722
00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.400
okay so

723
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.559
that is the reason why i'm not trying to

724
00:25:56.559 --> 00:25:57.679
emphasize on this

725
00:25:57.679 --> 00:25:58.960
particular point that the threshold

726
00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.640
voltage is meant to create both

727
00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.440
basically

728
00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.600
we assume that the value of vgs in this

729
00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.600
case is required for both

730
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.600
to create the depletion as well as to

731
00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.039
create a thin layer of channel

732
00:26:09.039 --> 00:26:12.640
just an assumption okay now let me just

733
00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.559
get back the

734
00:26:14.559 --> 00:26:17.120
figure here okay so i have just created

735
00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.159
some voltage

736
00:26:18.159 --> 00:26:20.480
that is slightly above the value of vdh

737
00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.279
okay so

738
00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:23.679
very tiny bit of voltage more than the

739
00:26:23.679 --> 00:26:24.400
value of

740
00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.200
vth so now that it has depleted my

741
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.039
carriers which is given in the dark gray

742
00:26:29.039 --> 00:26:29.520
color

743
00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.480
okay so it has depleted the carriers and

744
00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:32.799
like

745
00:26:32.799 --> 00:26:34.240
the majority carries underneath the

746
00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.480
channel and also it has pulled out

747
00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.640
the electrons so the electrons are shown

748
00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.080
as a kind of bubbles

749
00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:43.600
white color circles i guess the pictures

750
00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:44.159
are clear

751
00:26:44.159 --> 00:26:48.240
so if you want i can enlarge a bit

752
00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.600
okay so now in order to create this

753
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.440
channel i need almost like

754
00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.200
10 uh electrons to create this

755
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.480
particular channel okay

756
00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.320
and this is the condition that i have in

757
00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.000
vbs when there is no potential

758
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.919
difference between the source

759
00:27:01.919 --> 00:27:04.880
and the body okay so when both these uh

760
00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.080
nodes are at the same potential

761
00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.320
this is what happens but the moment i

762
00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.760
try to apply some sort of potential

763
00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.120
difference say for example the source

764
00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.039
node is slightly higher than the value

765
00:27:13.039 --> 00:27:13.760
of zero

766
00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.840
okay then in that case what happens is

767
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.159
that there is a positive charge

768
00:27:18.159 --> 00:27:20.000
okay and that positive charge will pull

769
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.279
out an electron

770
00:27:21.279 --> 00:27:23.840
out of this particular region okay so

771
00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:24.480
now that

772
00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.159
the channel is not completely formed

773
00:27:26.159 --> 00:27:27.840
because uh one of the electron has been

774
00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.440
pulled off from the channel that is

775
00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:30.640
created okay

776
00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.840
now it is left over with just nine

777
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.200
so now in order to create a channel

778
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.960
i need 10 electrons to completely fill

779
00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.640
this particular zone between the

780
00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.559
source and the drain okay i need an

781
00:27:42.559 --> 00:27:44.559
extra electron so how will i get that

782
00:27:44.559 --> 00:27:46.399
extra electron

783
00:27:46.399 --> 00:27:48.320
which is a minority carrier so what i

784
00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.240
supposed to do

785
00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.520
so increasing vg increase yeah

786
00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.480
so in in that case i need to increase

787
00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:56.880
the

788
00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.840
value of vg okay so in turn i can also

789
00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.200
visually see that

790
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.880
the threshold voltage of the device has

791
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.640
also been raised up okay

792
00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.799
because for this value i have already

793
00:28:06.799 --> 00:28:07.840
created

794
00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.679
the channel as was the depleted region

795
00:28:09.679 --> 00:28:10.880
okay but

796
00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.600
just because the vsb is rised higher it

797
00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.360
has lost one of the electron and due to

798
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:15.760
which

799
00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:18.240
the threshold voltage of the device has

800
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.039
also

801
00:28:19.039 --> 00:28:22.080
been shooted up yeah so we are modeling

802
00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:22.480
this

803
00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.840
particular physical phenomena through

804
00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.679
this particular expression of

805
00:28:25.679 --> 00:28:28.720
vt okay so whenever there is a rise in

806
00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.760
the potential difference between the

807
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.039
source and the body the threshold

808
00:28:31.039 --> 00:28:32.720
voltage of the device also rises

809
00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.200
okay that is it loses that electron and

810
00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.159
i need

811
00:28:36.159 --> 00:28:38.399
an extra voltage to actually create a

812
00:28:38.399 --> 00:28:39.919
very thin layer of channel between the

813
00:28:39.919 --> 00:28:40.720
source and the

814
00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.799
body okay so this is something that

815
00:28:42.799 --> 00:28:44.480
gives you a visual feel like

816
00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.799
why the threshold voltage of the device

817
00:28:46.799 --> 00:28:48.000
increases the moment

818
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.399
the vsb starts rising okay you may also

819
00:28:50.399 --> 00:28:51.440
wonder like what happens

820
00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.600
when you have the reverse condition okay

821
00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.520
so say for example i have

822
00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.279
negative and a positive here then

823
00:28:57.279 --> 00:28:59.200
obviously you need a very less threshold

824
00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.880
voltage okay that's a different story

825
00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:01.840
and

826
00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.320
when we talk about a digital vlsi design

827
00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.080
we will never encounter this condition

828
00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.000
that is we will not have this vsb in the

829
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.600
negative direction just because

830
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.480
the body of our inverse structure will

831
00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.679
be at the ground okay

832
00:29:13.679 --> 00:29:15.279
it cannot be pulled to any positive

833
00:29:15.279 --> 00:29:18.799
values due to which our vsb

834
00:29:18.799 --> 00:29:22.080
becomes a negative okay so there won't

835
00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.919
be any such situation where the source

836
00:29:23.919 --> 00:29:26.960
is pulled lower than zero volt okay

837
00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.720
so that is the condition and uh we

838
00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.080
always encounter an increase in the

839
00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.679
value of vdh okay

840
00:29:31.679 --> 00:29:33.679
so the next thing that we have to

841
00:29:33.679 --> 00:29:34.880
discuss

842
00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.039
is again uh that is related to threshold

843
00:29:37.039 --> 00:29:38.080
voltage

844
00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.039
which is known as short channel effect

845
00:29:41.039 --> 00:29:41.360
and

846
00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.760
there is also one more effect which is

847
00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:44.880
called as drain

848
00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.360
induced

849
00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:54.399
barrier lowering okay

850
00:29:54.399 --> 00:29:56.399
so again all the three effects that i

851
00:29:56.399 --> 00:29:58.559
have discussed including this uh

852
00:29:58.559 --> 00:30:01.360
body effect one and the short channel

853
00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:01.840
effects

854
00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.240
two and the third one which is the drain

855
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.520
induced barrier lowering all these

856
00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.279
effects are related to the threshold

857
00:30:07.279 --> 00:30:07.840
voltage

858
00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.720
okay now in the case of a short channel

859
00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:11.279
device

860
00:30:11.279 --> 00:30:14.640
what happens is that it is the reduction

861
00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.360
in the threshold

862
00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:18.720
voltage with respect to the length of

863
00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.080
the

864
00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:22.399
channel okay so i'll talk about this

865
00:30:22.399 --> 00:30:23.120
whereas

866
00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.440
at drain induced barrier lowering it's a

867
00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.520
kind of effect of threshold voltage with

868
00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:30.080
respect to

869
00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:33.520
the value of medials okay so and the

870
00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.360
body effect

871
00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.880
so which is nothing but it's a steady of

872
00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.480
a threshold voltage

873
00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.520
with respect to vsb clear so

874
00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:42.960
if i am trying to talk a threshold

875
00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.039
voltage with respect to vsb then we call

876
00:30:45.039 --> 00:30:46.480
that effect as a body effect

877
00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.360
if i am talking threshold voltage effect

878
00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.080
because of the

879
00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.679
change in the length of the channel we

880
00:30:51.679 --> 00:30:53.120
are calling that effect as a kind of

881
00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.240
short channel effect

882
00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.320
and drain induced barrier is an effect

883
00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:57.600
where the threshold voltage of the

884
00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.320
device

885
00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:01.200
varies with respect to videos okay so

886
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:01.519
this

887
00:31:01.519 --> 00:31:03.760
effect comes into picture only for short

888
00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:04.640
channel device

889
00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:07.279
and even the same applicable for this as

890
00:31:07.279 --> 00:31:08.480
well okay

891
00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.279
now why does this happen uh when we put

892
00:31:11.279 --> 00:31:12.000
ourselves

893
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.679
into a question the one thing that we

894
00:31:13.679 --> 00:31:15.519
have to note is that we always define

895
00:31:15.519 --> 00:31:17.120
that the threshold voltage is only a

896
00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.360
function of

897
00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.399
vgs okay a more practical example is

898
00:31:22.399 --> 00:31:24.000
that we always assume that the mother is

899
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.279
the only responsible to

900
00:31:25.279 --> 00:31:26.960
bring up their child okay so this is

901
00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.480
something similar to that

902
00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.159
and this is the assumption that we had

903
00:31:30.159 --> 00:31:31.600
before okay

904
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.919
but now we know that both the husband

905
00:31:33.919 --> 00:31:35.279
and wife has to play a role

906
00:31:35.279 --> 00:31:36.640
in bringing up the child the same

907
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.640
similar reason can apply

908
00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.640
okay so when i get into this short

909
00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.559
channel

910
00:31:42.559 --> 00:31:44.559
what happens is that let us look across

911
00:31:44.559 --> 00:31:45.679
this first

912
00:31:45.679 --> 00:31:48.000
physical thing okay as i said a

913
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:48.960
threshold voltage

914
00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.919
has to do two jobs one of the job is to

915
00:31:51.919 --> 00:31:54.960
deplete the charges

916
00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.279
okay so that was its major preliminary

917
00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:01.279
job and then later it has to pull

918
00:32:01.279 --> 00:32:04.559
the magnetic carriers now

919
00:32:04.559 --> 00:32:06.799
when i reduce this channel length what

920
00:32:06.799 --> 00:32:08.399
happens is that you can just barely

921
00:32:08.399 --> 00:32:11.760
compare these two things having a very

922
00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.679
long channel

923
00:32:13.679 --> 00:32:15.760
and the one that has very shorter

924
00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.080
channel

925
00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.519
now if this is a an n-mos we have to

926
00:32:21.519 --> 00:32:23.679
have a p-type material a p-type

927
00:32:23.679 --> 00:32:25.120
substrate for both these

928
00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:28.000
structures and the length of this

929
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.760
particular channel is quite

930
00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:31.279
large than compared to the length of the

931
00:32:31.279 --> 00:32:33.440
channel that is required here

932
00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.080
now let us try to draw the depleted

933
00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.919
region around the pn junction okay

934
00:32:37.919 --> 00:32:39.440
so now in this case we know that the

935
00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.440
depletion region surrounds the source

936
00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.000
and the drain

937
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.159
okay and we also know that there is a

938
00:32:44.159 --> 00:32:45.440
part of the channel has already been

939
00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.600
depleted because of this pn junction

940
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.320
okay and even here a part of the channel

941
00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.760
has been depleted

942
00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.480
already by this pn junction but as we

943
00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.600
compare the length

944
00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.039
over which the depleted region is

945
00:32:57.039 --> 00:32:58.720
created this is like

946
00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.679
a very very small fraction so we can

947
00:33:01.679 --> 00:33:03.120
approximately say that

948
00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.120
in order to create a repeated region for

949
00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.320
this threshold voltage

950
00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.919
we always assume that it's a function of

951
00:33:07.919 --> 00:33:09.760
one d v g

952
00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:13.360
okay so i have to apply enough vgs

953
00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.799
to create a depleted region under this

954
00:33:16.799 --> 00:33:19.200
oxide region okay but when i look here

955
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.559
the length of the channel has already

956
00:33:20.559 --> 00:33:21.600
been reduced

957
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.720
now this pn junction has already

958
00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.799
depleted a part of the channel okay

959
00:33:26.799 --> 00:33:29.919
and due to which you no need to create

960
00:33:29.919 --> 00:33:31.919
a depleted region at these junctions

961
00:33:31.919 --> 00:33:33.519
okay all of these charges are being

962
00:33:33.519 --> 00:33:35.360
depleted by this pn junction diodes

963
00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.360
itself okay so the only thing is that

964
00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:39.200
you are left over to deplete only this

965
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.880
part of the channel which requires a

966
00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.320
very less voltage than compared to

967
00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.679
deplete the entire

968
00:33:43.679 --> 00:33:46.240
length of the channel okay so this is in

969
00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.120
the case of a

970
00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:49.200
long channel and this is in the case of

971
00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.120
a short channel

972
00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.519
okay so hope that it is clear so due to

973
00:33:53.519 --> 00:33:55.440
which the threshold voltage that is

974
00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.799
required to deplete the charges

975
00:33:56.799 --> 00:33:57.679
underneath the

976
00:33:57.679 --> 00:34:00.000
channel has got reduced okay so now let

977
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.159
us try to plot them physically okay so i

978
00:34:02.159 --> 00:34:02.720
just want

979
00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:05.120
to plot only the graph and we will not

980
00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.720
get into the modeling part

981
00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:10.000
as we had for body effect okay so

982
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.320
this is my length and let us assume like

983
00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.159
uh we have 45 nanometers

984
00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:17.359
so let me have 45 nanometer and let me

985
00:34:17.359 --> 00:34:20.399
mark almost like one micro meter

986
00:34:20.399 --> 00:34:22.079
and all of these lengths are more than

987
00:34:22.079 --> 00:34:23.839
that okay so now that when you try to

988
00:34:23.839 --> 00:34:26.079
plot this

989
00:34:26.079 --> 00:34:28.000
the threshold voltage will not be a

990
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.440
function of a length

991
00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:32.079
till a particular technology but as as

992
00:34:32.079 --> 00:34:33.599
and when when we try to reduce

993
00:34:33.599 --> 00:34:35.918
the technology as i said due to this

994
00:34:35.918 --> 00:34:37.918
physical reason

995
00:34:37.918 --> 00:34:39.440
the threshold voltage of the device

996
00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.960
starts reducing

997
00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.719
okay and this is for 45 nanometer

998
00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:48.480
clear so this effect

999
00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.159
of reduction in the threshold voltage we

1000
00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:51.760
call that effect as a

1001
00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:55.119
short channel effect okay

1002
00:34:55.119 --> 00:34:58.320
yeah so now can you guess

1003
00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.839
what could be the drain induced barrier

1004
00:34:59.839 --> 00:35:02.160
lowering and how does this impact our

1005
00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:06.160
threshold voltage any idea

1006
00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:09.599
so that means uh in short channel effect

1007
00:35:09.599 --> 00:35:12.079
for 45 nanometers

1008
00:35:12.079 --> 00:35:14.560
the vt will be the vt will be very small

1009
00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.359
in the sense yes yes

1010
00:35:17.359 --> 00:35:19.920
yeah but actually if i try to plot the

1011
00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.480
same thing

1012
00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.920
in your cadence it will not happen no

1013
00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.599
the reason behind is that there is some

1014
00:35:25.599 --> 00:35:27.040
sort of uh

1015
00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:29.839
heavily doped region underneath this uh

1016
00:35:29.839 --> 00:35:30.720
layer

1017
00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:33.359
which is known as a halo implant doping

1018
00:35:33.359 --> 00:35:33.760
okay

1019
00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.480
and due to which in reality you will not

1020
00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.440
have this kind of

1021
00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:40.640
carrot uh but rather when you try to

1022
00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:41.040
plot

1023
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.880
this is my vd okay so

1024
00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.960
versus the length the camera would look

1025
00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.359
weird you will have a very high

1026
00:35:49.359 --> 00:35:51.359
uh threshold voltage and then you would

1027
00:35:51.359 --> 00:35:52.400
get something like this

1028
00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.040
okay and the reason why it has become

1029
00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.280
something like this is because of the uh

1030
00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:00.800
halo implant okay so we will not talk

1031
00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.480
too much about this implant

1032
00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.960
how does it behaves and things like that

1033
00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.200
but because of this reason okay or

1034
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.720
it can also be called as a pocket

1035
00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.800
implant because of this kind of

1036
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.880
effect you would find that the short

1037
00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.960
voltage of the short channel device

1038
00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:18.160
is not as i proved theoretically

1039
00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:19.280
something like this okay

1040
00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:21.520
it is something in another direction and

1041
00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.040
the reason for this is because of the

1042
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.160
fabrication that they

1043
00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.960
have introduced okay because as you said

1044
00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.480
once the threshold voltage of the device

1045
00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:29.440
becomes very small

1046
00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:30.960
it becomes too difficult for us to

1047
00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.880
control the current flow

1048
00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.560
because we know that the mass transistor

1049
00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:37.200
is a is a voltage controlled current

1050
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:37.680
device

1051
00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.800
okay so if we are not having the hold on

1052
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:41.200
the

1053
00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.200
voltage then it becomes difficult for us

1054
00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.560
to control the flow of current between

1055
00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:45.520
the source and the drain

1056
00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.119
and due to which there are some

1057
00:36:47.119 --> 00:36:49.440
fabrication steps that have been taken

1058
00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.000
and if you want i can show even the

1059
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:52.880
graph of this

1060
00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.320
but i think we are running out of time

1061
00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.680
probably in the next class i will show

1062
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.960
the graph for this

1063
00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.400
as well as the drain induced barrier

1064
00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.480
lowering okay yeah so now

1065
00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.760
the the only question is that i just

1066
00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.200
want to end this particular node with

1067
00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:03.599
this

1068
00:37:03.599 --> 00:37:05.839
discussion what happens to threshold

1069
00:37:05.839 --> 00:37:07.040
voltage when we have

1070
00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:10.400
vds say for example i take two

1071
00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.240
values of vds vds when it is equal to

1072
00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.400
zero volt and the value of vds that is

1073
00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:14.960
equal to

1074
00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.880
some positive voltage like 0.6 volt or

1075
00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.000
something and

1076
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.480
the third one is at 1.2 volt now what

1077
00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.800
happens to each of these

1078
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.520
voltages will the threshold voltage

1079
00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.119
reminds the same for all

1080
00:37:27.119 --> 00:37:30.320
or will it increases

1081
00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:33.839
or will it decreases which among these

1082
00:37:33.839 --> 00:37:34.480
possible

1083
00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.160
physical phenomena can happen okay

1084
00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:37.680
either constant

1085
00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.560
as vt or it might increase or it might

1086
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.760
decrease so

1087
00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.880
so you have option a b

1088
00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:49.359
as well c and i also forgot to tell

1089
00:37:49.359 --> 00:37:51.200
about one more thing uh velocity

1090
00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.720
saturation effect

1091
00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.960
uh maybe maybe after this i'll take

1092
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:55.920
another five minutes

1093
00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:59.280
uh and then i will leave the class

1094
00:37:59.359 --> 00:38:00.800
but you need to come up with the answers

1095
00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.839
which of the physical phenomena can

1096
00:38:02.839 --> 00:38:04.079
happen

1097
00:38:04.079 --> 00:38:07.200
so due to means by seeing the challenge

1098
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.880
modulation it will decrease most

1099
00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:12.320
vt will decrease no as

1100
00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:15.520
so as the channel will reduce

1101
00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.520
no uh what happens where the moment i

1102
00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.520
increase this potential

1103
00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:21.359
if this is my drain what happens the

1104
00:38:21.359 --> 00:38:22.560
moment i increase the potential when

1105
00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:25.359
compared to the body

1106
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:28.480
what happens to this depleted region is

1107
00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:33.839
this p-n junction is reverse past

1108
00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.800
it's reverse bias so i'm trying to

1109
00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:37.680
increase the

1110
00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:39.359
reverse bias means that the depleted

1111
00:38:39.359 --> 00:38:40.880
region around this segment will also

1112
00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.040
increase

1113
00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:46.560
am i right so what you're actually doing

1114
00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.240
is that you're trying to deplete most of

1115
00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:48.560
the

1116
00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.040
charges underneath the gate just because

1117
00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.400
the channel is already small

1118
00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.800
and you're depleting more of the charges

1119
00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.760
underneath this

1120
00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.320
so what happens to the threshold voltage

1121
00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:00.000
a part of the job is already done by the

1122
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.359
value of vds

1123
00:39:01.359 --> 00:39:03.680
he has already depleted for me so the

1124
00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.680
only job that is left over is to deplete

1125
00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:07.440
only this part of the

1126
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.960
channel so do i need a very high

1127
00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.560
threshold voltage or

1128
00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.079
will the threshold voltage will shrink

1129
00:39:14.079 --> 00:39:16.000
down

1130
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.599
shrinks down yeah it would reduce right

1131
00:39:19.599 --> 00:39:20.079
because

1132
00:39:20.079 --> 00:39:22.240
and this effect we call call it as drain

1133
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.839
induced barrier lowering okay

1134
00:39:23.839 --> 00:39:26.160
but uh certainly isn't it similar to

1135
00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.240
satellite modulation

1136
00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.480
modulation is about saturation current

1137
00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.320
but in this case uh it is about the

1138
00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.760
threshold voltage is what we are

1139
00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.800
concerned

1140
00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.280
that is a current equation okay so but

1141
00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:37.920
uh

1142
00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:40.000
in both the cases we are just increasing

1143
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.040
vds like

1144
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000
of course of course yeah yeah yeah so

1145
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.760
like the channel and modulation effect

1146
00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.760
we can observe even for

1147
00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.359
channel length uh that is greater than

1148
00:39:53.359 --> 00:39:54.880
one micron also

1149
00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.599
if if you look back the current equation

1150
00:39:57.599 --> 00:39:58.720
that i've used for the channel

1151
00:39:58.720 --> 00:39:59.920
modulation is still

1152
00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.920
a long channel current equation only

1153
00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.960
okay and

1154
00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:04.960
as you could guess that as i raise the

1155
00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.000
value of vds

1156
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.319
the value of vt is also reducing and

1157
00:40:08.319 --> 00:40:09.520
this is the physical phenomena that

1158
00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.640
happens only for

1159
00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.119
very short channel devices okay and we

1160
00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:14.160
will not really

1161
00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.000
worry about this effect when we are

1162
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.200
working

1163
00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.640
across a very long channel like

1164
00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.800
something like this okay so for channel

1165
00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.000
length of this

1166
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.680
depleting part of the channel doesn't

1167
00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:25.119
make much change

1168
00:40:25.119 --> 00:40:28.400
but the depletion of the charges becomes

1169
00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.319
a huge impact when we go for a shorter

1170
00:40:30.319 --> 00:40:31.680
channel okay maybe

1171
00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.599
the one reason that i can give why we

1172
00:40:33.599 --> 00:40:35.440
are discussing all of these effects

1173
00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:38.720
separately means that we always go for

1174
00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.599
linear model okay the reason why we are

1175
00:40:41.599 --> 00:40:43.200
always interested in linear model is

1176
00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:43.599
that

1177
00:40:43.599 --> 00:40:45.359
you know that superposition theorem

1178
00:40:45.359 --> 00:40:47.520
right say for example uh you have some

1179
00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.200
two potentials and you want to calculate

1180
00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.560
the current flow through the device or

1181
00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.680
something like that okay

1182
00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:53.359
and we know that maybe i'm not having

1183
00:40:53.359 --> 00:40:55.119
the appropriate

1184
00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:57.040
circuit conditions here okay let me just

1185
00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.560
try to apply some something like this

1186
00:40:58.560 --> 00:40:59.119
okay

1187
00:40:59.119 --> 00:41:02.000
or maybe a plus three volt or something

1188
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:02.560
so now

1189
00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.920
now to analyze the whole current that

1190
00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:06.000
flows between them what i can do is that

1191
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:06.640
i can

1192
00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.079
just because the resistance is a linear

1193
00:41:08.079 --> 00:41:09.760
device i could model

1194
00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:12.240
by taking one voltage at a time and then

1195
00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:13.040
try to

1196
00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.960
add up those results in order to get the

1197
00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.160
total current okay

1198
00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:18.319
so even here it would be always better

1199
00:41:18.319 --> 00:41:19.760
to model them

1200
00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.599
as a separate functions okay so we are

1201
00:41:21.599 --> 00:41:22.880
trying to model them as a separate

1202
00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:23.359
functions

1203
00:41:23.359 --> 00:41:25.280
assuming that these transits are

1204
00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.200
somewhat linear so that i can

1205
00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:30.400
add up those impacts later on okay so

1206
00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.680
that is what we have studied in the

1207
00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.440
channel in modulation we we never

1208
00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.599
considered any of these effects

1209
00:41:35.599 --> 00:41:37.839
and we just spoke about only the how the

1210
00:41:37.839 --> 00:41:40.640
current varies with respect to vds okay

1211
00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.319
and we just gave us a kind of separate

1212
00:41:42.319 --> 00:41:44.480
name something like that

1213
00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:48.960
okay i hope uh you're clear

1214
00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:51.359
yes sir uh this drain induced barrier

1215
00:41:51.359 --> 00:41:52.480
lowering uh

1216
00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:55.280
is it uh dominating only in the short

1217
00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.160
channel

1218
00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:59.119
yes yes this is an impact that happens

1219
00:41:59.119 --> 00:42:00.560
only in the short channel

1220
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.880
if the length of the channel is more as

1221
00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.520
i said the depletion around this

1222
00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:06.800
uh when we compare to the total

1223
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.640
depletion is barely small

1224
00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:10.319
okay so the the fraction of depletion

1225
00:42:10.319 --> 00:42:12.319
that this vds creates

1226
00:42:12.319 --> 00:42:14.640
is a very small tiny amount so we

1227
00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:15.920
generally assume that it's only a

1228
00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:18.160
function of vgs and we never consider

1229
00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.200
it as a function of vds okay but the

1230
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.800
drain induced barrier lowering

1231
00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:25.760
says that the vt is not only a function

1232
00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.560
of vgs but it's also

1233
00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:32.720
a function of vds

1234
00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:35.599
okay so it's a function of both these

1235
00:42:35.599 --> 00:42:38.000
voltages

1236
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.680
and that impact will happen only for

1237
00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.760
shorter channel device okay

1238
00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.839
yeah so with this note i just want to

1239
00:42:43.839 --> 00:42:44.960
talk about every

1240
00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:47.040
last point about the velocity saturation

1241
00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.560
effect okay so i guess

1242
00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:50.640
you might be familiar with this equation

1243
00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.560
yes

1244
00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.160
okay so this was the equation that we

1245
00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.760
have used and what happens is that

1246
00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.440
in this case you could see that there is

1247
00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.359
a denominator term that is also a

1248
00:42:59.359 --> 00:42:59.920
function of

1249
00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:03.040
e so now when i try to plot e versus the

1250
00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.560
drift velocity

1251
00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.160
it is not as kind of straight line that

1252
00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:07.599
i can plot okay

1253
00:43:07.599 --> 00:43:10.480
and i cannot use this straight line

1254
00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.119
where i

1255
00:43:11.119 --> 00:43:13.040
could write the drift velocity to be

1256
00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:15.119
equal to mu n times it of

1257
00:43:15.119 --> 00:43:17.680
e okay but what happens is that when i

1258
00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:20.079
try to plot this as a whole

1259
00:43:20.079 --> 00:43:23.680
you would get as a kind of curvature

1260
00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.359
and then it reaches to the velocity

1261
00:43:25.359 --> 00:43:26.800
saturation effect okay

1262
00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.920
so every time the slope changes so this

1263
00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:31.760
becomes very hard for us to really uh

1264
00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:34.720
predict the value of things okay so

1265
00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.079
there is something known as piecewise

1266
00:43:36.079 --> 00:43:37.839
modeling so you would have learned

1267
00:43:37.839 --> 00:43:41.119
the same thing in your body plot right

1268
00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:43.839
whenever you have a pole the gain of

1269
00:43:43.839 --> 00:43:44.319
your

1270
00:43:44.319 --> 00:43:46.240
system will reduce at a rate of minus 20

1271
00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:48.000
db per decade and you can use this

1272
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.920
piecewise approximation okay

1273
00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:52.720
so yeah as electric field increases we

1274
00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.480
should get negative and also negative

1275
00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:59.599
direction because as you increase

1276
00:43:59.599 --> 00:44:01.599
yeah yeah i think all of these proves i

1277
00:44:01.599 --> 00:44:03.520
have done uh earlier you can just watch

1278
00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:04.880
those videos why we are getting

1279
00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:07.359
a drift velocity in terms of this maybe

1280
00:44:07.359 --> 00:44:08.960
we will discuss about this because the

1281
00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.960
electric field is running between the

1282
00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:13.440
between the drain and the source and we

1283
00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.400
are using the

1284
00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.000
charge carrier flowing from source to

1285
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.760
drain so based on that

1286
00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.599
we have this negative sign getting

1287
00:44:19.599 --> 00:44:20.880
changed but

1288
00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:23.119
it's basically a function where as i

1289
00:44:23.119 --> 00:44:24.480
increase the electric field

1290
00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:27.680
the velocity also increases okay

1291
00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.359
it cannot go the other way since because

1292
00:44:29.359 --> 00:44:32.400
it has a negative value

1293
00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:36.079
okay yeah so now if at all if i

1294
00:44:36.079 --> 00:44:37.599
want to model this as a kind of

1295
00:44:37.599 --> 00:44:39.359
piecewise model that we have used like

1296
00:44:39.359 --> 00:44:41.040
even in the case of a

1297
00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:45.440
kind of bode plot then one could use

1298
00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:48.160
this piecewise model as vd that is equal

1299
00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:48.640
to

1300
00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:51.520
mu n times that of e when the electric

1301
00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:52.319
field

1302
00:44:52.319 --> 00:44:55.040
is less than the critical electric field

1303
00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:55.520
okay

1304
00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:58.319
this vd drift policy becomes equal to

1305
00:44:58.319 --> 00:45:00.480
saturation velocity

1306
00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.400
for e that is greater than or equal to

1307
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.000
critical electric field okay

1308
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.839
so based on this we have had some sort

1309
00:45:05.839 --> 00:45:07.520
of question

1310
00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.200
uh maybe i'll just show you the question

1311
00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:10.800
and the answer of this we will discuss

1312
00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.240
in the next class

1313
00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:16.400
okay so because of this approximation

1314
00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.079
i could write that the drift velocity is

1315
00:45:18.079 --> 00:45:19.839
nothing but mobility times the electric

1316
00:45:19.839 --> 00:45:20.319
field

1317
00:45:20.319 --> 00:45:22.640
whereas the other way around is that

1318
00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:23.839
when the electric field

1319
00:45:23.839 --> 00:45:28.000
is maybe i have to switch over this

1320
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.400
equal symbol here okay then the vsat

1321
00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:31.200
would be

1322
00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:34.160
equal to mu n times zero of ec okay so

1323
00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:34.880
now we have

1324
00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:36.960
we one could use this equation where i

1325
00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.079
need to connect both these

1326
00:45:38.079 --> 00:45:40.960
uh expressions okay at electric field

1327
00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:42.480
that is equal to e c

1328
00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.800
then v sat is equal to mu n times that

1329
00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:46.400
of easy is what i can write it

1330
00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:49.280
okay hope uh this is clear this is the

1331
00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.880
field that i have

1332
00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.880
for an electric field that is equal to

1333
00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:55.040
ec where i can

1334
00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:58.480
equate both these quantities okay so

1335
00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:02.560
based on this what one can do is that

1336
00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:05.280
one could rewrite the saturation

1337
00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.240
velocity

1338
00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.400
v d sat in terms of the critical

1339
00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.920
electric field

1340
00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:13.520
okay and this e c

1341
00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:16.560
is nothing but can be written as

1342
00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:19.359
v sat divided by mu n okay so we have

1343
00:46:19.359 --> 00:46:22.720
this kind of a good relation

1344
00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.640
that could be derived just by this

1345
00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:25.839
approximation

1346
00:46:25.839 --> 00:46:30.240
clear so there is a small question here

1347
00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.400
the critical voltage is what you need to

1348
00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.160
compute for the pmos transistor

1349
00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:36.960
and the pmos transistor has an effective

1350
00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.240
mobility which is given as

1351
00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:41.280
38 centimeter square per volt per second

1352
00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.119
okay and avalanche saturation

1353
00:46:43.119 --> 00:46:45.680
which is around 7 into 10 to the power 7

1354
00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:46.800
centimeter

1355
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:50.000
per second okay and you you have to

1356
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:50.800
assume that

1357
00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:54.839
we have an abrupt change in the velocity

1358
00:46:54.839 --> 00:46:57.520
okay so which means that we are trying

1359
00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:59.119
to talk about this kind of field

1360
00:46:59.119 --> 00:47:01.520
the one at the blue okay so there is an

1361
00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:02.880
abrupt change

1362
00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:05.359
from the linear motion to this constant

1363
00:47:05.359 --> 00:47:06.160
velocity

1364
00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.880
here so when you have such condition

1365
00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:09.520
what is the

1366
00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.839
critical voltage that you have assuming

1367
00:47:11.839 --> 00:47:13.359
that the channel length of the transfer

1368
00:47:13.359 --> 00:47:14.160
is

1369
00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.560
equal to 200 nanometer okay so i want

1370
00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.359
you to work out

1371
00:47:17.359 --> 00:47:20.160
this particular example okay i guess i

1372
00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.599
have taken too much of time

1373
00:47:21.599 --> 00:47:25.839
i just stopped here
