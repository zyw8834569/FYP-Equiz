WEBVTT

1
00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:12.000
so rather than muting it i

2
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.359
i just did the call-in okay yeah

3
00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:19.039
yeah so this is basically due to the

4
00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.560
tunneling effect which is basically a

5
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.720
quantum mechanical effect that happens

6
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.720
for the flow of current through the

7
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.080
oxide okay

8
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.920
and again there is one more type of

9
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.439
leakage current that flows

10
00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.760
that is primarily due to the pn junction

11
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.479
diodes

12
00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.559
because we know that a reverse biased pn

13
00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.239
junction will also have some sort of

14
00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.640
reverse saturation current okay so due

15
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.160
to that mechanism there will be a

16
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.000
kind of current flow between the source

17
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.760
and the body or between the drain and

18
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.399
the body

19
00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.480
okay so these are some of the leakage

20
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.520
current and uh

21
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.440
today we'll focus more on the sub

22
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.879
threshold conduction okay

23
00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.960
and there are some set of problems that

24
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.879
could come around this particular

25
00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.399
threshold connection we will do some set

26
00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.239
of problems as well okay

27
00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.680
yeah now

28
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.359
let me begin with this topic

29
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.159
so as i said a subthreshold connection

30
00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.840
is a kind of current flow that happens

31
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
between the source and the drain even

32
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.560
for the value of vgs

33
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.799
that is less than vt okay so we call

34
00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.240
that non-zero current as the sub

35
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.520
threshold conduction okay

36
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.119
so now we'll just look into like why

37
00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.040
this is happening or how how exactly we

38
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.360
can

39
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.920
model this particular current okay so

40
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.520
now what we do is that uh

41
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.640
normally when we try to plot a graph of

42
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.159
ids versus vgs

43
00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.600
what we assume is that the current is

44
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.840
almost zero till i reach the value of

45
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.520
vgs that is equal to vt

46
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.360
and after then you assume that there is

47
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.640
a kind of quadratic nature

48
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.799
and uh after a while the device will

49
00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.159
enter into linear

50
00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.520
so there will be some sort of straight

51
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.360
line after this okay yeah so we will not

52
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.880
worry much about this

53
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.640
cara which is above the value of vt okay

54
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.520
now in this case we would see that the

55
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.360
curve that i have drawn here is almost

56
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.799
flat okay so

57
00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.520
but rather if i try to change the scale

58
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.800
of this particular axis

59
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.720
that is my y-axis in terms of

60
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.959
logarithmic okay

61
00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.160
with a base of 10 and when i try to

62
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.760
replot this

63
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.040
graph we would see something different

64
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.840
okay

65
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.440
okay so we would see some sort of

66
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.599
characteristics and this characteristics

67
00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:28.239
happens

68
00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.160
the moment the value of regis is less

69
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.239
than vt okay so

70
00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.040
now when i have this kind of cara which

71
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.080
has been plotted

72
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.080
against this logarithmic scale of this

73
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.760
uh ideas

74
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.599
okay so so logarithmic scale uh would

75
00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:44.400
then be

76
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.640
in terms of 10 to the power i'm just

77
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.800
choosing some random number okay so that

78
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.879
the step size would be in terms of uh

79
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.519
something in this particular scale okay

80
00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.920
so so every equal increment will be

81
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.400
in terms of decay clear so when i see

82
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.680
this particular

83
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.879
you could see that there is a linear

84
00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.480
relation that exists between this

85
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.400
logarithmic scale of ideas

86
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.319
and the value of vgs that is less than

87
00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.680
the value of vd okay

88
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.080
so now the way to model this particular

89
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.720
picture

90
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.879
is we can use some sort of concept that

91
00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.000
we have studied in

92
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.720
vjt okay so first let me try to explain

93
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.319
why this current flows and through what

94
00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.000
type of mechanism this current flows

95
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.640
okay

96
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.239
and later we'll just try to model this

97
00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.480
part of the current that actually flows

98
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.080
for the value of v so that is less than

99
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.640
v t clear

100
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.640
and again i'm just taking this n mass

101
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.319
transistor

102
00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.080
so clearly we could see that there is an

103
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.200
n which is basically the source terminal

104
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.799
okay and then there is a kind of

105
00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.040
p type semiconductor okay which is

106
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.239
basically the body

107
00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.000
so there is an en pen transistor

108
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.959
right so it is it could be visualized

109
00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.680
something like this

110
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.159
with some sort of a parasitic bjt

111
00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:59.599
transfer that is being formed just

112
00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.040
because of this pn junction

113
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.920
diodes across the source in the body and

114
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.519
across the drain and the

115
00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.680
body okay so due to which there happens

116
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.120
to be some sort of reverse bias and we

117
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.799
know that each of these pn junctions are

118
00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.319
basically reversed by us

119
00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.360
and it is through this

120
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.918
the current flows okay and whatever

121
00:04:17.918 --> 00:04:18.720
current is that

122
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.040
it's it's basically a reverse saturation

123
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.839
current

124
00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:25.040
okay now let us try to model this

125
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.040
particular current okay so i'm not going

126
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.800
to explain how exactly these currents

127
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.840
have been written down but i'll just

128
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.000
give the final expression okay

129
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.080
so the current that is flowing for the

130
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.600
value of vgs

131
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.680
that is less than vt could be modeled

132
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.639
with some sort of

133
00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.720
expression okay so now the way that this

134
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.680
particular plot

135
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.280
shows a kind of linear characteristics

136
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.759
between the logarithmic scale of ideas

137
00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:48.160
versus a linear scale of vgs one could

138
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.000
see that there is a kind of relation

139
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.880
okay so

140
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.960
now can anyone tell me like what type of

141
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.400
relation that these

142
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.680
the ideas and vgs

143
00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.880
defines in this particular zone where uh

144
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.080
we are trying to plot against the

145
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.840
logarithmic scale of

146
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.759
10. linear no it cannot be linear right

147
00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:08.720
because

148
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.560
yeah it's actually linear so which means

149
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.080
that i have something like logarithmic

150
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.120
scale

151
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.880
and this is my y-axis so y equals to mx

152
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.280
so that can be some sort of slope value

153
00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.560
exponential

154
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.639
yeah yeah that is what i wanted okay so

155
00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.320
now that in order to remove this

156
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.479
logarithmic scale i have to take

157
00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:27.520
anti-log

158
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.880
which is nothing but the exponential on

159
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.800
both the sides when i do this then what

160
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.759
happens is that

161
00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:33.520
you would end up having some something

162
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.440
like exponential term okay

163
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.600
so so this is what we would end up so

164
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.639
even our

165
00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.520
case the current equation that i am

166
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.120
about to write will also have this kind

167
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.840
of exponential

168
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.360
relation with respect to the value of v

169
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.600
g s okay so

170
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.360
there is a reverse saturation current

171
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.960
which i am writing it as just

172
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.360
is okay sometimes it can also be written

173
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.080
as

174
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.800
ids naught okay so we will not worry

175
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.199
about

176
00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:59.440
what notation to be used okay in general

177
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.880
there is some sort of reverse saturation

178
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.759
current

179
00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:04.080
and that current has to be multiplied

180
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.880
with some sort of excuse me sir

181
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.360
yeah uh the log is taken based in

182
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.000
november

183
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.440
so how can it be exponential uh

184
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.199
e supposed to be longer yes if it's long

185
00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:18.840
it'll be exponential that

186
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.039
even so it's supposed to be long right

187
00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:26.639
okay then i think it's fine yeah

188
00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:27.759
yeah it's supposed to be some sort of

189
00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:30.080
logarithmic scale and they actually gets

190
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.880
related with

191
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.520
an exponential term okay and again uh

192
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.080
this is

193
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.479
a concept basically through this bjt

194
00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:38.080
structure that we are trying to derive

195
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.600
okay

196
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.199
yeah so here we have some sort of term

197
00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:44.720
through which we could be able to relate

198
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.960
the value of vgs okay and also there is

199
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.160
also one more term that

200
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.400
happens over because of the pn junction

201
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.919
that happens because of the drain

202
00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:53.759
to source or basically because of the

203
00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:55.039
drain and source

204
00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:57.360
we also have some sort of current flow

205
00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.479
because we need some sort of

206
00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:01.759
potential difference between the drain

207
00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:02.720
and the source in order to make the

208
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.240
current to flow right so we need some

209
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.880
sort of

210
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.280
component that is relating to our vds

211
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.120
okay so again this is

212
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.639
uh there is no proof that i can give for

213
00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:13.280
this

214
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.880
it's just the equation that i'm just

215
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.560
writing it down and

216
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.479
right now if at all if the value of this

217
00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:19.759
vds okay

218
00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:22.160
if the value of this vds is much much

219
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.400
greater than the thermal voltage

220
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.120
which is nothing but kt by q okay maybe

221
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.720
i could write it as

222
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.759
vk okay so that uh we will use this vt

223
00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:32.080
for

224
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.000
uh representing the threshold voltage

225
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.840
and vk for representing the thermal

226
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.039
voltage okay

227
00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:39.919
so if this expression is satisfied then

228
00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:41.599
obviously what happens is that the e to

229
00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:42.240
the power

230
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.160
most negative term would end up having a

231
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.440
value of 0 okay

232
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.759
so in that case one could approximate

233
00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:49.759
this current flow of ids to be

234
00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:54.000
equal to is into e to the power of v g s

235
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.520
minus v t divided by n times that of v k

236
00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.240
okay so i've just reduced this

237
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.160
expression of kt by q

238
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.080
as just vk and then i have substituted

239
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.440
that notation over here

240
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.639
okay yeah so this is the current flow

241
00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:09.280
and now

242
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.919
one could also wanted something out of

243
00:08:11.919 --> 00:08:12.400
this

244
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.479
device right so when i try to plot this

245
00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:16.000
particular camera we will try to

246
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.280
evaluate the slope factor

247
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.319
okay so i want to evaluate the slope

248
00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:20.800
factor

249
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.520
with something known as s and i will try

250
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.120
to define this flow factor

251
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.520
we want to switch to to the very lowest

252
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.240
current

253
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.400
at the earliest okay so i want the slope

254
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.840
to be much steeper

255
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.919
okay i want to decrease at a much faster

256
00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:34.958
rate okay

257
00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.640
so this is what we want to evaluate

258
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.240
through this flow factor the rate at

259
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.440
which i am trying to switch off

260
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.000
supposed to be much faster okay so that

261
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.959
can be read by the slope factor

262
00:08:44.959 --> 00:08:47.040
uh excuse me sir can you repeat it i

263
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.399
couldn't follow what you

264
00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:50.720
explained yeah yeah so i'm talking about

265
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.839
the slope factor so

266
00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:53.200
this flow factor is an important

267
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.200
quantity in order to know

268
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.440
whether our device can quickly turn off

269
00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.640
to a very

270
00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.320
small amount of current the moment i

271
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.760
switch the value of vgs

272
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.160
below the value of vt i want this

273
00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:04.800
current

274
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.160
to go to a very low values so we we

275
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:08.800
basically

276
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.720
want to measure the slope factor of this

277
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.800
in order to measure how fast the

278
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.080
current is getting reduced

279
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.000
for the value of vgs that is below the

280
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.519
value of vt okay so

281
00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:22.320
that is the measure that we are doing in

282
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.600
terms of slope factor

283
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.160
okay so let me try to define uh more

284
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.519
formally rather than

285
00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:30.720
speaking it out so i'm just going to

286
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.279
define

287
00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:33.120
a factor which is known as slope factor

288
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.839
yes which basically measures

289
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.839
the inverse rate okay

290
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:50.320
of decline of ideas

291
00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.160
with respect to vgs

292
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.360
below the value of vt okay so

293
00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.279
it actually measures the quality of the

294
00:09:59.279 --> 00:10:01.360
technology or of the mosfet that we are

295
00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:01.920
using

296
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.079
okay so now the way that we are going to

297
00:10:04.079 --> 00:10:05.680
measure this particular slope factor

298
00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.120
is by reading out the slope value of

299
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.560
this okay so now what i am going to do

300
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.160
is that i am just going to take

301
00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.800
two different currents okay and then the

302
00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.680
corresponding

303
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.880
vgs values okay say for example i'm just

304
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.240
picking one of the current at which

305
00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.320
my ids 1 is equal to 10 to the power

306
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.600
minus 7 okay

307
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.320
and the corresponding value of vgs let

308
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.279
me take it as v

309
00:10:31.279 --> 00:10:34.399
one okay and let me take the second one

310
00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:35.120
which is the

311
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.160
ids two where the current id2 supposed

312
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.839
to be a decade away from this

313
00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:42.160
value of ids one clear so clearly there

314
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.920
is a difference of ten

315
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.320
between both these currents and i choose

316
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.440
that corresponding value of vgs as vgs2

317
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.320
here so you got the differences right so

318
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.600
now that i just want to measure the

319
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.640
slope factor

320
00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.560
i make use of this equation that i have

321
00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.079
written down earlier

322
00:10:58.079 --> 00:11:01.279
that i have ids 1 which is basically

323
00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:03.440
equal to 10 to the power minus 7

324
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.760
okay amperes and that is

325
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.800
related to the value of vgs as vgs 1

326
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.399
minus vt divided by n times that of kv

327
00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:16.959
now i have one more current which i have

328
00:11:16.959 --> 00:11:18.000
taken

329
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.480
which is a decade away from this ids one

330
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.160
okay the idea is two

331
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.600
the difference between the ids one and

332
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.440
ids two supposed to be

333
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.959
ten okay and that can be

334
00:11:28.959 --> 00:11:32.720
returned in terms of the same expression

335
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.720
but in the place of regis i am just

336
00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.240
speaking as vgs2

337
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.959
okay the corresponding value of vgs2 so

338
00:11:38.959 --> 00:11:39.760
now what i

339
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.839
can do is that i divide both these

340
00:11:41.839 --> 00:11:43.040
equations

341
00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.399
okay one divided by two then

342
00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:49.839
i would end up having something like

343
00:11:49.839 --> 00:11:52.000
this

344
00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.440
i will take long on both the sides okay

345
00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.839
so that

346
00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.920
so this delta v g s is what i'm going to

347
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.040
define as the

348
00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.000
slope factor which can be written as i'm

349
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.680
just going to expand this

350
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:16.160
which is kt by q in the place of vk

351
00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.200
and then into lon of 10 and the unit for

352
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.000
this

353
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.279
would be like

354
00:12:23.279 --> 00:12:27.200
millivolt per decade

355
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.120
so hope that you're clear with the slow

356
00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.279
factor here so the slow factor is

357
00:12:31.279 --> 00:12:33.200
something that we are trying to measure

358
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.240
for the current that flows

359
00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.720
below the value of v g s that is less

360
00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.760
than the value of v t

361
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.079
okay and how are we measuring is that we

362
00:12:42.079 --> 00:12:43.680
are taking two currents that are a

363
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.800
decade of

364
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.800
difference between them clear so i've

365
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.880
just chosen here 10 to the power minus 7

366
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.000
as one of the current and

367
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.920
the other current that i'm taking is 10

368
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.120
to the power minus 8

369
00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.800
okay so i've taken that difference and

370
00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.560
the corresponding regions values i have

371
00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.360
taken

372
00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.040
and then when i try to measure their

373
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.200
differences supposed to be equal to this

374
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:06.959
okay so now clearly for room temperature

375
00:13:06.959 --> 00:13:10.320
okay that is for a

376
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.440
temperature of 300 kelvin okay

377
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:18.000
one could write this vk or this kt by q

378
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
would be approximately equal to

379
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.920
sometimes 25 millivolt

380
00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.680
or sometimes they used to write 26

381
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.240
millivolt okay so

382
00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.760
what we do is that we'll just fix this

383
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.399
26 millivolt as our quantity here

384
00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:33.600
okay and in case if the value of n

385
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.000
is equal to 1 then i just want you to

386
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.320
compute what is the slope factor of that

387
00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.480
okay so this is just a kind of ideal

388
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.600
case where

389
00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.959
having an n that is equal to 1 is pretty

390
00:13:44.959 --> 00:13:48.560
pretty much rare okay so i just want you

391
00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.399
to compute and get me the value of this

392
00:13:50.399 --> 00:13:51.760
slope factor for

393
00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.920
n that is equal to one so that you can

394
00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.279
just directly substitute here

395
00:13:55.279 --> 00:13:57.040
and you have to have your calculator in

396
00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.240
order to compute the remaining part

397
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.199
okay so the value would be closer to 60

398
00:14:03.199 --> 00:14:04.880
millivolt per decade

399
00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.440
okay yeah so exactly if you want it is

400
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.079
like 59.86 but we would approximate that

401
00:14:10.079 --> 00:14:11.040
to be closer to

402
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.360
60 millivolt per decade now what does

403
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.120
this tells us

404
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.519
okay this is the most important thing

405
00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:18.399
now

406
00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:21.839
this tells me that in order to reduce

407
00:14:21.839 --> 00:14:24.880
the current from 10 to the power minus 7

408
00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.440
to 10 to the power minus 8 i need only

409
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.360
60 millivolt

410
00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.240
difference between the vgs okay so this

411
00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.040
is actually

412
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.639
a better quantity but let us take

413
00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:38.639
en that is equal to 1.5 which is

414
00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:39.920
normally found

415
00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.279
in the mos technologies okay so when i

416
00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:45.040
have

417
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.040
the n that is equal to 1.5 the slope

418
00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.079
factor becomes

419
00:14:48.079 --> 00:14:50.959
something like 90 millivolt per decade

420
00:14:50.959 --> 00:14:52.480
now what does this mean

421
00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.519
which number is good

422
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.760
having s that is equal to 60 millivolt

423
00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.839
is good or having yes that is equal to

424
00:14:59.839 --> 00:15:00.800
90 millivolt

425
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.720
per decade is good so which one among

426
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.880
you

427
00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.480
okay you see in order to reduce from

428
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.480
uh 10 to the power minus 7 to 10 to the

429
00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.519
power minus 8 i have to have

430
00:15:13.519 --> 00:15:17.920
the difference the v gs1 has to change

431
00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.399
to v gs2 so that the vgs 2 can be

432
00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:21.839
returned as vgs 1

433
00:15:21.839 --> 00:15:24.560
plus 90 millivolt so i need a 90

434
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.560
millivolt to reduce this current

435
00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.560
whereas here when i have n that is equal

436
00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.759
to one

437
00:15:29.759 --> 00:15:31.519
okay so let's say for example i have

438
00:15:31.519 --> 00:15:33.120
regis one here and

439
00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.320
i could write this vgs two as we just

440
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.040
one plus just sixty millivolt so which

441
00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.839
one is good in this case

442
00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.519
which is stepping down much faster

443
00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:49.120
n equal to 1 yeah n equals to 1 because

444
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.880
i need only 60 millivolt to reduce the

445
00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.560
current from 10 to the power minus 7 to

446
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.199
10 to the power

447
00:15:53.199 --> 00:15:56.000
minus 8 okay so this is actually better

448
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.759
option than compared to this one

449
00:15:57.759 --> 00:16:00.320
okay so maybe the way that i have marked

450
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.759
here as a slope factor

451
00:16:01.759 --> 00:16:03.360
might confuse you though the only thing

452
00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.000
that i wanted here is that

453
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.279
through the slope factor we are trying

454
00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:09.680
to evaluate

455
00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.880
this quantity okay so

456
00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.639
how much of the vgs that i needed you

457
00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:16.560
know reduce the current a decade below

458
00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:16.959
okay

459
00:16:16.959 --> 00:16:19.279
so the rate at which i want to reduce is

460
00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:20.639
what we are trying to compute through

461
00:16:20.639 --> 00:16:21.040
this

462
00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.120
slope factor s okay or the differences

463
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.639
in the value of vgs okay

464
00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:26.639
if i could able to make this vgs1 and

465
00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:28.639
vgs2 as close as possible

466
00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:30.480
then the rate at which this would

467
00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.800
decline would be much faster okay so for

468
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:33.360
this

469
00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.600
new graph that i've drawn you could see

470
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.600
that i need only a small amount of v

471
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.959
just to reduce from 10 to the power

472
00:16:38.959 --> 00:16:41.040
minus 7 to 10 to the minus 8

473
00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.920
okay so in that case the s factor will

474
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.880
be

475
00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.480
much smaller okay so i need

476
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.800
s to be small or basically the delta

477
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.920
which is to be small

478
00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.240
in order to reduce the current by a

479
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.360
decade

480
00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.560
okay hope that it makes sense so we want

481
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.160
this delta which is to be as small as

482
00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:00.720
possible

483
00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.959
okay so in this case having an n factor

484
00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:04.559
that is equal to 1 will give us the

485
00:17:04.559 --> 00:17:07.919
minimum v just to reduce the current

486
00:17:07.919 --> 00:17:11.039
by a decade okay yeah

487
00:17:11.039 --> 00:17:14.160
so now let us do a simple problem here

488
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.599
yeah hope that you could be able to see

489
00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:17.599
this particular problem so what is the

490
00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:18.079
minimum

491
00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:20.799
threshold voltage for which the leakage

492
00:17:20.799 --> 00:17:21.520
current

493
00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:24.079
through the off transistor that is when

494
00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:26.720
vgs is equal to zero is ten to the power

495
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:30.160
for three times lesser than the transfer

496
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.520
that is barely on

497
00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.520
when we just is equal to bt okay so

498
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.520
uh assume that the value of n is equal

499
00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.160
to 1.5 okay so we would be solving two

500
00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:40.559
things

501
00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:42.960
okay one with n that is equal to 1.5 the

502
00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.280
other one with n that is equal to 1.3

503
00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:45.760
okay

504
00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.720
so soi stands for silicon on insulator

505
00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.400
which is again a kind of technology

506
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.840
through which mos transits can be

507
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.799
fabricated

508
00:17:52.799 --> 00:17:54.960
okay so we will talk about these things

509
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.960
later on when we discuss about this unit

510
00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.760
number five okay so as of now we'll just

511
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:00.880
won't worry about this

512
00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.840
sy or any other factor okay we'll worry

513
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.039
about only the factor of

514
00:18:05.039 --> 00:18:08.480
n so now given this question how would

515
00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:08.960
we

516
00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.360
actually start so we actually wanted you

517
00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.720
to calculate the threshold voltage of

518
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.320
the device

519
00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.760
based on the given data we know that

520
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.360
the current there is some sort of

521
00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.559
current okay

522
00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:25.840
at these two points one when the value

523
00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.360
of vgs is at vt

524
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.120
there is some current which is ids one

525
00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.039
let us take and there is also one more

526
00:18:31.039 --> 00:18:31.679
current

527
00:18:31.679 --> 00:18:34.799
okay which is ids2 when vgs

528
00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:38.080
is equal to zero okay so and the

529
00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.600
difference between these two

530
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.640
are 10 to the power 3 okay

531
00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:46.160
that is ids 1 is 10 to the power

532
00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.200
3 times greater than the value of ids 2

533
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.440
okay that is what has been given here

534
00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.919
now we want you to compute the value of

535
00:18:53.919 --> 00:18:54.720
vt

536
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:58.160
based on this expression so how i can

537
00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.520
rewrite those

538
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.400
currents when the value of vgs is equal

539
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.000
or less than the value of vt

540
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.280
how i can replace this ids1 and ids2

541
00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.600
expressions and we also have to assume

542
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.440
that the value of vds is

543
00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.200
much larger than the thermal voltage

544
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.880
okay so this is an assumption so

545
00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.960
we can leave out the exponential part

546
00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.400
that was there in the original

547
00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.120
expression okay

548
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.240
so we can use i s into e to the power of

549
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.520
something

550
00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.000
yes yes yes yeah this is what we wanted

551
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:30.799
actually

552
00:19:30.799 --> 00:19:34.320
so in this case we know that in general

553
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.320
i can bring out the expression of ids

554
00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.559
okay so which is defined as is e to the

555
00:19:40.559 --> 00:19:42.320
power vgs

556
00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.600
minus vt divided by n times that of

557
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.400
vk okay so i can use this equation and i

558
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.679
can write it as is

559
00:19:49.679 --> 00:19:52.799
e to the power and the value of vgs that

560
00:19:52.799 --> 00:19:53.440
i have

561
00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.799
when i am at vt will become zero right

562
00:19:56.799 --> 00:20:00.080
so vg is yeah so what happens to the

563
00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:00.960
exponential of

564
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.400
zero one it will be one okay

565
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.600
yeah so it is something like i s into

566
00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.960
one

567
00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.919
okay and on the other hand i have again

568
00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:12.799
i is

569
00:20:12.799 --> 00:20:14.640
e to the power and what is the value of

570
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.480
v j's that i have here

571
00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.280
that is equal to zero right yeah so i

572
00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.280
have something like minus vt divided by

573
00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.799
n times that of vk okay

574
00:20:24.799 --> 00:20:26.880
so i could cancel out this these two

575
00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.320
terms and

576
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.240
i could bring the exponential on the

577
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:34.240
other side

578
00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.600
vk and i have this 10 to the power 3

579
00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.640
and take long on both the sides

580
00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:44.000
so that we can get rid of this

581
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.520
so through this formula i could find the

582
00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.200
value of the threshold voltage of the

583
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.159
transistor

584
00:20:50.159 --> 00:20:53.360
okay so you can use this vk to be 26

585
00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.159
approximately 26 millivolt okay at the

586
00:20:56.159 --> 00:20:57.760
room temperature

587
00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:02.080
and you just get me the value of this so

588
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.679
269 milli

589
00:21:03.679 --> 00:21:06.960
ah yeah so approximately it comes around

590
00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.280
yeah closer to this

591
00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:11.760
269.4 approximately i can write it as

592
00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.840
270 millivolt okay and that is the

593
00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.360
threshold voltage of this particular

594
00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.400
transfer

595
00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.159
so now there is one more part of this

596
00:21:18.159 --> 00:21:20.640
okay if at all if i'm using this

597
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.559
soi which has a smaller value of

598
00:21:24.559 --> 00:21:26.559
n what is the threshold voltage that is

599
00:21:26.559 --> 00:21:27.919
required for sy

600
00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:31.360
if n is equal to 1.3 okay

601
00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.360
so now this time what i do is that i

602
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.400
know that

603
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.559
i could rewrite this expression on the

604
00:21:36.559 --> 00:21:37.600
other way

605
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.720
okay so which is nothing but vt can be

606
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:41.440
written as

607
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.960
n times vk and there is a lawn

608
00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.960
to the 10 to the power 3 right so this 3

609
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.159
can be brought

610
00:21:48.159 --> 00:21:50.559
in front and i can write it as lon of 10

611
00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:51.200
itself

612
00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.000
right so now this particular quantity

613
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.039
that i have here

614
00:21:55.039 --> 00:21:56.480
is a well known factor which is nothing

615
00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.720
but the s okay

616
00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.880
and just by multiplying by a factor of

617
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.159
three would get me the

618
00:22:02.159 --> 00:22:04.240
threshold voltage of the device okay so

619
00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.520
now in case

620
00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.360
if i know this s factor so

621
00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.480
now for sy we know that

622
00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.840
the n is said to be 1.3 okay so based on

623
00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:16.640
this quantity

624
00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.720
first let us try to calculate this slope

625
00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.159
factor and then we

626
00:22:20.159 --> 00:22:21.679
we know that this slow factor has to be

627
00:22:21.679 --> 00:22:23.520
multiplied by a factor of 3

628
00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.440
in order to get the value of the

629
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.120
threshold voltage of the transistor

630
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.200
right so i can use this way as well okay

631
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.720
so this is one more way

632
00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.640
by which we can find the threshold

633
00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:33.919
voltage okay

634
00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:35.600
or you can use the same expression the

635
00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.120
only thing is replace this n with a

636
00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.360
factor of 1.3 that is also fine okay

637
00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.400
so sometimes given an s factor

638
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.559
we can directly do this as well clear

639
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.520
so this is the slope factor that i have

640
00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.360
and once i know this flow factor

641
00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.919
what i can do is that i can just

642
00:22:53.919 --> 00:22:55.679
multiply by a factor of three

643
00:22:55.679 --> 00:22:59.280
to get put into okay

644
00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.440
yeah so now what i'm going to do is that

645
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.480
i'm just going to

646
00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.520
run in a much faster phase okay

647
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.000
so the second type of leakage that we

648
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:08.799
have

649
00:23:08.799 --> 00:23:10.720
is about the gate leakage and as i said

650
00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.480
this leakage happens just because the

651
00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.159
thickness of the oxide for lower

652
00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:15.440
technologies

653
00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.320
has been dropped to a thickness which is

654
00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.440
almost like 15

655
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.000
to 20 amp strong so which is like 10 to

656
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.440
the power minus 10

657
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.440
meters okay and due to which what

658
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.559
happens is that there is some

659
00:23:26.559 --> 00:23:28.080
phenomena which is known as tunneling

660
00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.840
that happens and that results

661
00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.240
in this gate leakage current okay and

662
00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.000
again this gate tunneling can be

663
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:34.799
classified

664
00:23:34.799 --> 00:23:36.799
physically into two kind of physical

665
00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:37.919
mechanisms

666
00:23:37.919 --> 00:23:40.400
one is like fn tunneling okay which is

667
00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.200
more important

668
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.279
when we have a moderate thickness

669
00:23:43.279 --> 00:23:44.880
basically this kind of tunneling is

670
00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.679
used for programming the ee probe okay

671
00:23:47.679 --> 00:23:49.120
so apart from this we will not discuss

672
00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.880
much about those gate leakage

673
00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.559
things and there is also a direct

674
00:23:52.559 --> 00:23:54.240
tunneling and this direct

675
00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.880
internally happens even at low voltages

676
00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.279
with

677
00:23:57.279 --> 00:23:59.200
very thin oxide and this is the most

678
00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.840
dominant leakage component that we have

679
00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.320
for the lower technologies okay so the

680
00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.919
direct handling is one of the dominant

681
00:24:05.919 --> 00:24:07.039
factor

682
00:24:07.039 --> 00:24:10.240
when you go for lower technologies

683
00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.480
that's it we will not go much in depth

684
00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.360
and the final

685
00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:16.080
type of junction leakage that we have is

686
00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:17.840
about the pn junction okay so here i

687
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.600
have a structure which is known as

688
00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.200
n well structure we will talk about this

689
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.360
envelope

690
00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.720
and there is something known as twin

691
00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.720
turb and many such factors

692
00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.400
when we discuss about unit number five

693
00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.240
okay so as of now you assume that an

694
00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:30.880
envelope

695
00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.039
is something where we will have this

696
00:24:33.039 --> 00:24:34.960
pmos transistor

697
00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.799
and the piece of state is where we will

698
00:24:36.799 --> 00:24:38.000
have these nmos

699
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.120
transistors clear

700
00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.720
so as you could able to see that there

701
00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.600
is a pn junction okay across the source

702
00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.640
and the body and even in the case of

703
00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.720
a pmos transfer there is some sort of pn

704
00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.240
junction diodes okay

705
00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.840
now we know that normally these p

706
00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.159
injection diodes are in general reverse

707
00:24:56.159 --> 00:24:58.480
bias

708
00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.000
so in this case you could see that there

709
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.679
is a p substrate

710
00:25:01.679 --> 00:25:03.520
so this p substrate is connected to the

711
00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.440
ground through this p plus region okay

712
00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.880
so it is something like we are trying to

713
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.000
fix some sort of

714
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.679
body potential which is generally a

715
00:25:09.679 --> 00:25:11.360
ground for

716
00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.080
an nmos transfer so similarly i would be

717
00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:14.960
having

718
00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.279
an envel this end well is completely

719
00:25:17.279 --> 00:25:19.520
biased to a vdd okay so

720
00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.240
to some power supply clear so there is

721
00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.600
some sort of reverse bias

722
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.600
between this pn junction due to these

723
00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.600
kind of body that has been connected to

724
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.200
a fixed potential okay

725
00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.360
whereas the source and the drain may or

726
00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.440
may not have the same potential as we

727
00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.200
have for the body okay so they may have

728
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.039
a higher potential than compared to this

729
00:25:37.039 --> 00:25:38.480
uh in the case of an n-type

730
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.480
semiconductor whereas in the case of a

731
00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.080
p-type semiconductor

732
00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.960
these p plus regions normally will take

733
00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.320
voltages which are

734
00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.799
either equal to v db or sometimes lower

735
00:25:48.799 --> 00:25:50.080
than the value of v d d

736
00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.039
here so right now you might not be able

737
00:25:53.039 --> 00:25:54.799
to appreciate this particular phenomena

738
00:25:54.799 --> 00:25:55.760
just because

739
00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.559
we still have to go a long way okay so

740
00:25:58.559 --> 00:25:59.520
the only thing is that

741
00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.240
these pn junction diodes are in general

742
00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.360
they are reverse biased

743
00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.960
okay and whenever there is a reverse

744
00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.640
biased pn junction we know that there is

745
00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.000
some sort of leakage current and one

746
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.279
could model that

747
00:26:09.279 --> 00:26:10.640
reverse bias leakage current through

748
00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.320
this kind of expression okay

749
00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:16.159
so here in this case so yeah

750
00:26:16.159 --> 00:26:20.080
so why is there uh p plus and n plus in

751
00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.880
p substrate so what is the user why will

752
00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.120
this

753
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.600
because this is for the source and this

754
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.279
is for the drain

755
00:26:31.279 --> 00:26:33.440
these n plus regions that are there in

756
00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.720
our p substrate

757
00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.960
is by construction uh we will have this

758
00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.159
kind of structure

759
00:26:38.159 --> 00:26:40.240
i'm talking about p plus and p minus

760
00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.679
substitutes that

761
00:26:41.679 --> 00:26:44.720
what does what are the negatives

762
00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:47.440
this one you're talking this people okay

763
00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.080
yeah yeah

764
00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.240
so this is something like we are heavily

765
00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.120
doped this

766
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.600
p type material just because in order to

767
00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.880
reduce the resistivity

768
00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.880
because even the resistance of the

769
00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.480
material will also matters when we try

770
00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.320
to apply some sort of potential

771
00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.279
say for example if i have a very large

772
00:27:03.279 --> 00:27:04.080
resistance

773
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.600
the voltage that i am applying here 5

774
00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.520
volt will be dropped

775
00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.520
very heavily when the resistance is

776
00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.440
large okay so we want to reduce the

777
00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.480
resistance so that

778
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.480
i could at least produce something like

779
00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.520
4.9 volt

780
00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:18.080
if the value of resistance is small okay

781
00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.720
but in case if the resistance is large

782
00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.760
okay then when i apply a five volt

783
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.760
then at this point i would get something

784
00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.520
like five point sorry four point eight

785
00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:27.919
or

786
00:27:27.919 --> 00:27:29.520
four point seven volt something like

787
00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.880
that okay so we want to reduce that

788
00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.320
resistance when we try to apply

789
00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.399
some sort of potentials here okay so due

790
00:27:34.399 --> 00:27:36.880
to which we generally go for heavy doped

791
00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.159
materials here

792
00:27:38.159 --> 00:27:39.520
that's the reason why we have this p

793
00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.360
plus regions here and

794
00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.760
over here there is an n plus regions so

795
00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.039
which is basically meant to

796
00:27:45.039 --> 00:27:48.080
bias this body

797
00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.559
body of both the pmos as with the nmos

798
00:27:50.559 --> 00:27:53.440
does it make sense

799
00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:57.440
sir i didn't understand properly so

800
00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.360
because he said that

801
00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.919
for for increasing the voltage we use

802
00:28:01.919 --> 00:28:04.159
the p plus n cluster

803
00:28:04.159 --> 00:28:06.720
so but how are the damage in this uh

804
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.240
formula

805
00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.000
no no you see the entire body is

806
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.679
supposed to have some sort of potential

807
00:28:11.679 --> 00:28:14.240
some sort of voltage okay so now i am

808
00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.440
applying a voltage through this

809
00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.080
particular

810
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:19.200
ground okay and that voltage has to be

811
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.200
supplied through this entire structure

812
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.360
okay but the opening that i'm giving

813
00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:23.679
here

814
00:28:23.679 --> 00:28:25.919
is it's something like how i can say

815
00:28:25.919 --> 00:28:27.520
okay so every material that

816
00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.080
that we use has some sort of resistance

817
00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:30.640
okay

818
00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.559
so say for example when i'm trying to

819
00:28:32.559 --> 00:28:33.760
apply some 5 volt

820
00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.760
even when you take a metal okay a

821
00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.799
lengthy wire

822
00:28:36.799 --> 00:28:39.840
which runs like kilometers away so this

823
00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.600
230 volt that you apply

824
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.600
in one end when you reach to the other

825
00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.880
end it will be like

826
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:48.640
220 volt okay so basically there's some

827
00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.240
sort of resistances that is along the

828
00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:50.799
path

829
00:28:50.799 --> 00:28:52.720
okay and in order to reduce the

830
00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.159
resistance we use this uh

831
00:28:54.159 --> 00:28:56.000
aluminium wires the reason why we are

832
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.080
going for aluminum wire is that

833
00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.640
the resistance of those wires are bit

834
00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.360
less

835
00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.640
okay so even here i'm trying to

836
00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.480
apply this potential because it's a

837
00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.320
planar structure like i have to talk

838
00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.080
more about the semiconductor

839
00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.159
over here but these things has to be

840
00:29:12.159 --> 00:29:14.399
discussed during our unit number five

841
00:29:14.399 --> 00:29:16.720
so planar fabrication is something like

842
00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.080
all our terminals will be

843
00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.679
at the top level so we will have a

844
00:29:19.679 --> 00:29:22.080
general substrate or something

845
00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:25.440
like a p substrate okay

846
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.600
and then what i do is that i i try to

847
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.200
dope things like a p

848
00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.640
plus material with some sort of masking

849
00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.200
and then

850
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.679
later there will be a metalization okay

851
00:29:35.679 --> 00:29:36.640
and then

852
00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.880
i will have a wire and through the wire

853
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.159
i would be connected to

854
00:29:40.159 --> 00:29:42.000
an external power supply like a five

855
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.679
volt uh supply okay

856
00:29:43.679 --> 00:29:46.640
so what happens is that these voltages

857
00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.000
are the current flows

858
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.919
through this shorter wire will have a

859
00:29:49.919 --> 00:29:51.039
much larger resistance

860
00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:52.880
and again when i'm entering into the

861
00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.080
into the substrate

862
00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.960
i need a low resistance path okay so

863
00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.159
what we are trying to really

864
00:29:58.159 --> 00:30:00.399
do here is that we want to reduce this

865
00:30:00.399 --> 00:30:02.559
voltage that is getting dropped here

866
00:30:02.559 --> 00:30:04.720
we want to observe whatever the voltage

867
00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.960
that i have here

868
00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.080
onto this entire surface as uniform as

869
00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:10.640
possible

870
00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.039
uh it is something like to reduce the

871
00:30:13.039 --> 00:30:13.840
resistance

872
00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.159
not much uh physics behind this

873
00:30:16.159 --> 00:30:18.000
particular p plus region

874
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.080
okay dancer dancing yeah

875
00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.440
sorry if i couldn't able to explain

876
00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.679
properly

877
00:30:25.679 --> 00:30:28.240
yeah so but these structures will not

878
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.000
actually create any sort of p-n junction

879
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.840
it's only the opposite structure like n

880
00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.520
plus with p-type semiconductor will

881
00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.559
create a p-n junction

882
00:30:34.559 --> 00:30:37.120
and even here an n well which is nothing

883
00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.799
but an n substrate for

884
00:30:38.799 --> 00:30:42.000
a pmos uh will create a pn junction with

885
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:42.559
the p

886
00:30:42.559 --> 00:30:44.480
plus sources and the drain structures

887
00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.640
okay so those pn junctions are normally

888
00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:47.679
reversed by us

889
00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:50.000
and they generally conduct some small

890
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.039
current

891
00:30:51.039 --> 00:30:54.000
across them okay even the annul that i

892
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:54.799
have drawn here

893
00:30:54.799 --> 00:30:56.960
also creates some sort of bn junction

894
00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:57.919
between the

895
00:30:57.919 --> 00:31:00.399
p-type substrate and the zen well okay

896
00:31:00.399 --> 00:31:01.440
so you have

897
00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.840
almost like too many parasitic diodes

898
00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.120
throughout the interior structure

899
00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.600
okay and all of these structures work in

900
00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:08.640
the reverse bias

901
00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.320
conditions and due to which there will

902
00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.919
be obviously current flow through them

903
00:31:11.919 --> 00:31:13.840
okay and we call that as a junction

904
00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:14.960
leakage current

905
00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.559
yeah which is the current doesn't serve

906
00:31:16.559 --> 00:31:19.120
for any purpose it just goes waste

907
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.120
okay and one could model the current

908
00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:23.200
through this kind of equation where

909
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.360
the diode voltage vd can be returned as

910
00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.559
minus vsb

911
00:31:26.559 --> 00:31:28.880
between the source and the body or vdb

912
00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:32.000
between the drain and the body

913
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.840
yeah so nothing much apart from these

914
00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.919
discussions with respect to the leakage

915
00:31:35.919 --> 00:31:38.720
current so today we discussed about

916
00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.320
three type of leakages

917
00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:44.559
one is the sub threshold conduction

918
00:31:44.559 --> 00:31:47.919
the second one is the gate leakage

919
00:31:47.919 --> 00:31:50.000
so the most dominant is the direct

920
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
tunneling impact okay so due to this

921
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.039
tunneling effect

922
00:31:53.039 --> 00:31:54.960
the gate leakage current flows okay

923
00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.480
between the gate and the body

924
00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.840
and the third one is the junction

925
00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.200
leakage so these are the three important

926
00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.799
leakage current components that we have

927
00:32:02.799 --> 00:32:03.360
okay

928
00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.000
so the next couple of things as well

929
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:06.960
i'll just run

930
00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.799
very fast okay so there's nothing much

931
00:32:08.799 --> 00:32:10.399
to discuss the only thing that we are

932
00:32:10.399 --> 00:32:11.440
going to discuss is that there are

933
00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.960
certain parameters that varies with

934
00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.240
respect to the temperature

935
00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.279
okay so namely the mobility okay so the

936
00:32:17.279 --> 00:32:18.240
mobility of the

937
00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.399
carriers charge carriers generally

938
00:32:20.399 --> 00:32:21.679
decreases with the rise in

939
00:32:21.679 --> 00:32:24.880
temperature okay and the

940
00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.320
due to this what happens is that the

941
00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.159
saturation velocity also

942
00:32:28.159 --> 00:32:30.559
tries to gets reduced with respect to

943
00:32:30.559 --> 00:32:31.519
the temperature

944
00:32:31.519 --> 00:32:33.919
now the reason why this mobility getting

945
00:32:33.919 --> 00:32:35.519
reduced with respect temperature is that

946
00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:36.240
the lattice

947
00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.480
structure actually starts vibrating when

948
00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.760
you raise the temperature of the

949
00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.159
material okay and due to which the

950
00:32:42.159 --> 00:32:43.919
carrier will be get heated by these

951
00:32:43.919 --> 00:32:45.360
vibrated phonons

952
00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.120
and due to which the mobility of these

953
00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.640
those carriers will get reduced

954
00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.880
okay so once it gets reduced saturation

955
00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.880
velocity also gets reduced

956
00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.600
and the other components like the

957
00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.240
threshold

958
00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.200
of the device also decreases linearly

959
00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.399
with the rise in temperature

960
00:33:00.399 --> 00:33:03.600
okay and here again the on current okay

961
00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.600
also decreases with the rise in

962
00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.200
temperature

963
00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.120
and the sub threshold conduction which

964
00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.600
is the current which we don't want to

965
00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.559
exist rises exponentially with

966
00:33:14.559 --> 00:33:15.679
temperature okay so

967
00:33:15.679 --> 00:33:17.039
you see everything happens in the

968
00:33:17.039 --> 00:33:18.640
opposite direction we want higher

969
00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:19.840
mobility

970
00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.320
just to make the switch on and off very

971
00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.600
fast okay

972
00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.440
and we want this threshold voltage of

973
00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.640
the transfer to be

974
00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.279
much higher so that we can set some sort

975
00:33:29.279 --> 00:33:30.640
of switching voltages

976
00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.519
okay that again gets reduced and we

977
00:33:33.519 --> 00:33:35.279
don't want the substantial conduction

978
00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:37.679
current to exist at all but

979
00:33:37.679 --> 00:33:40.240
unfortunately when the temperature rises

980
00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.080
it increases exponentially

981
00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.559
and whereas the one good thing is that

982
00:33:44.559 --> 00:33:46.000
the gate leakage

983
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.360
okay there is something which is

984
00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.279
independent of the uh temperature

985
00:33:49.279 --> 00:33:50.720
because of the tunneling effect

986
00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.679
okay so so these are the side effects

987
00:33:53.679 --> 00:33:55.440
that we have and there are some couple

988
00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.480
of graph

989
00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:59.760
not too many okay it shows the the

990
00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:00.480
temperature

991
00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.919
variation with respect to the current

992
00:34:01.919 --> 00:34:04.080
okay so what happens the moment you

993
00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.000
have the increase in temperature how

994
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.200
does the graph

995
00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.520
shifts okay is what has been given okay

996
00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:10.879
so clearly

997
00:34:10.879 --> 00:34:12.639
the graph that has been plotted as id

998
00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:14.800
versus vgs was plotted against the

999
00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:15.679
square root of

1000
00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:18.719
ids okay so this is the case when we

1001
00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:19.199
have

1002
00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:21.359
saturation current okay so we know that

1003
00:34:21.359 --> 00:34:23.119
the saturation current

1004
00:34:23.119 --> 00:34:26.719
is actually returned as vgs minus vt the

1005
00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:27.359
whole square

1006
00:34:27.359 --> 00:34:29.599
okay so in order to show the linear

1007
00:34:29.599 --> 00:34:30.480
relation

1008
00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.239
we have taken a square root on both the

1009
00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:34.560
sides okay and that's the reason why

1010
00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.520
you would see the vgs was being plotted

1011
00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.480
against this

1012
00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.800
square root of ideas here and that shows

1013
00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.879
some sort of linear relation between the

1014
00:34:42.879 --> 00:34:44.639
temperature

1015
00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:48.000
vgs and the square root of ideas okay so

1016
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.040
you could see that at high values of vgs

1017
00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.560
the current has a negative temperature

1018
00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.159
coefficient so

1019
00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:55.760
what does it mean is that the rise in

1020
00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.839
temperature actually reduces the current

1021
00:34:57.839 --> 00:35:00.880
okay at high values of vgs but for low

1022
00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:03.680
values of vgs in this particular region

1023
00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.040
we have a positive temperature

1024
00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.119
coefficient so when i say positive

1025
00:35:07.119 --> 00:35:08.160
temperature coefficient

1026
00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.400
this means that a rise in temperature

1027
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.200
actually

1028
00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.320
raises the current okay so we will have

1029
00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.000
a high current when we have

1030
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.440
a positive temperature coefficient when

1031
00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:19.440
the temperature rises okay

1032
00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:22.079
so that's it and with this let me stop

1033
00:35:22.079 --> 00:35:30.160
here okay
