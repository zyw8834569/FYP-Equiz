WEBVTT

1
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.319
so

2
00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:07.919
we will just talk about this non-ideal

3
00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.360
iv characteristics of the

4
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.160
mosfet and i just want to quickly show

5
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.759
what are the non-ideal catalysts that we

6
00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:15.759
are going to discuss

7
00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.320
so there is a couple of topics and this

8
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.039
non-ideal

9
00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.720
iv characteristics effects comes into

10
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.480
picture only when we discuss about a

11
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.840
channel length that is

12
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.080
less than one micrometer but when you

13
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.519
consider a channel length there is more

14
00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.199
than one micrometer maybe

15
00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.119
the channel modulation uh effect would

16
00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.640
be there but not all other

17
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.640
effects would be uh taken into account

18
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.320
here so

19
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.239
whenever the technology that we are

20
00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.239
choosing is less than one micrometer

21
00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.040
technology

22
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.360
then all of these secondary effects will

23
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.399
come into picture

24
00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.360
okay the very first second order effect

25
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.399
that we are going to discuss

26
00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.559
would be like velocity saturation effect

27
00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:51.920
and the next one would be the mobility

28
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.360
degradation

29
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.120
and the third one which we have already

30
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.480
discussed is nothing but the channel and

31
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.160
modulation but still i will just

32
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.559
revisit this particular topic and then

33
00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.079
the body effect obviously you know what

34
00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:03.520
is body effect

35
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.959
there is some relation with respect to

36
00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.400
the body effect with the threshold

37
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.680
voltage of the device okay

38
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.159
we'll talk about that and there is also

39
00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.600
something known as short channel

40
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.360
effect and this structural effect is

41
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.119
again related to the threshold voltage

42
00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.880
okay and there is something known as

43
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.159
dibl or drain induced barrier lowering

44
00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.479
which is again related to the threshold

45
00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:23.439
rotate so

46
00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.680
if you just see the body effect the

47
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.880
short channel effect

48
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.360
the drain induced barrier lowering or in

49
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.960
shorter form it is known as the ibl

50
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.520
effect

51
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.520
so all of these three effects are in

52
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.840
general related to the threshold voltage

53
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.360
apart from this we also have something

54
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.880
known sub threshold conduction even

55
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.280
though

56
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.759
it is related to threshold voltage uh

57
00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:42.720
the phenomena is

58
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.399
more related to the current flow okay so

59
00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.840
that's why i am not included under the

60
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.040
threshold voltage topic

61
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.200
but it's a kind of separate subunit of

62
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.360
this non-ideal

63
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.399
second-order effects clear and

64
00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.320
again when we reduce the thickness of

65
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.759
the oxide when we go for lower

66
00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.439
technologies what happens is that

67
00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.040
there happens to be some sort of leakage

68
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.280
okay so we have two type of leakages

69
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.520
one is through the oxide so which is

70
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.799
which we call it as a

71
00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.959
gate oxide leakage and the other one is

72
00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.639
the junction leakage when there is a pn

73
00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:11.280
junction

74
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.280
so again there is some sort of current

75
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.879
flow through those pn junction because

76
00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.640
of a very high electric field around

77
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.000
them okay

78
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.520
and finally we will talk about this

79
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.360
mobility and the threshold voltage

80
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.400
variation with respect to the

81
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.200
temperature

82
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.640
so these impacts can be observed not

83
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.280
only

84
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.360
for the shorter channel but can be also

85
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.360
observed for the longer channel as well

86
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.560
okay so because generally the mobility

87
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.720
as well as the threshold voltage are

88
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.760
susceptible to

89
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.519
the variation in the temperature okay so

90
00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.599
we will be discussing some of the topic

91
00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:44.879
much more in depth but

92
00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.800
a few topics will not go much in depth

93
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.640
but rather something like a topic that

94
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.319
we discussed for

95
00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.400
diffusion capacitance so we'll be just

96
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.080
having a glimpse of it and will not go

97
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.879
much in depth

98
00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.959
clear now today i'll just try to cover

99
00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.040
this velocity saturation effect okay

100
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.120
so before we discuss about this velocity

101
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.200
saturation effect i just want to derive

102
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.120
the current equation of a longer channel

103
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.800
okay and then we'll just get into the

104
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.159
velocity structure effect

105
00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.840
and see how does this velocity

106
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.200
saturation effect

107
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.360
impact the current that flow between the

108
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.720
source and the drain

109
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.080
then i have a channel length that is

110
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.400
less than one micrometer here

111
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.519
so i'm just going to talk about two

112
00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:22.080
things

113
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.840
one i'm just going to call

114
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.519
long channel for

115
00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.360
a length that is greater than one

116
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.879
micrometer okay so

117
00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.959
long channel transistor if at all if i'm

118
00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.040
saying then i'm trying to specify that

119
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.400
the length of the channel is more than

120
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.360
one micrometer

121
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.239
okay if at all if i'm trying to say that

122
00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.799
i'm working on the shorter channel

123
00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.560
it generally assumes that the length of

124
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.879
the channel is less than one micrometer

125
00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.640
okay so these are the two notations i

126
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.319
will be using so whenever i'm referring

127
00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.680
to longer channel you can

128
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.439
always assume that the length of the

129
00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:56.720
channel is much larger

130
00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.640
okay and whenever i say it's a short

131
00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.840
channel the length of the channel is

132
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.120
less than one micrometer is the

133
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.400
assumption that you have to hold

134
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.879
okay now whenever we go for shorter

135
00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:05.840
channel

136
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.159
we have all this uh 10 effects that i

137
00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.760
have listed here okay

138
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.400
so let me derive each one of them

139
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.560
first in order to talk about the first

140
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.199
effect which is nothing but the velocity

141
00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.240
saturation effect i have to derive the

142
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.000
current equation for the long channel

143
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.919
okay and then i will just get into the

144
00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.160
short channel current equation okay how

145
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.400
does this velocity saturation impact

146
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.400
our current equation that we have been

147
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.919
using for a longer channel

148
00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.960
here now before i proceed i'll first

149
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.840
brief about

150
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.280
the theory behind this velocity

151
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.240
saturation effect clear

152
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.320
let me give some sort of analogy say for

153
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.639
example you have a bike which runs at a

154
00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.280
particular speed a maximum speed okay

155
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.600
say for example like 100 kilometers per

156
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.680
uh that is the maximum speed

157
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.880
but you you try to accelerate more than

158
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.320
that it is something like you have an

159
00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.199
accelerator

160
00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.240
right so you try to even though you you

161
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.280
try to push

162
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.919
uh your oscillator beyond the limit what

163
00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.520
happens is that

164
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.360
the bike will not go beyond a particular

165
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.360
speed the velocity of that particular

166
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.039
bike gets saturated okay

167
00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:15.280
200 kilometers per hour okay the same

168
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.360
similarly the electrons that exist

169
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.520
between the source and the drain across

170
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.199
the channel will also

171
00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:25.280
have some sort of saturation okay now

172
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.680
we know from the classical theory i

173
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.960
guess you are familiar with the drift

174
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.400
velocity right

175
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.680
so vd here talks about what is known as

176
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.360
a drift

177
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.759
velocity so what is the relation that i

178
00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:39.199
can specify

179
00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:40.479
between the drift velocity and the

180
00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.720
electric field how do i relate both

181
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.400
these quantities

182
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.440
you have a source in the drain okay

183
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.800
and there is some sort of potential

184
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.479
difference between this

185
00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.039
source and the drain so which means that

186
00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:54.960
i have some positive voltage across the

187
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.039
radius

188
00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:00.240
okay and this vds in short creates an

189
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.680
electric field between the source and

190
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.160
the drain

191
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.160
okay and let me call that electric field

192
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.680
as el okay which is

193
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.440
basically laterally there exists a

194
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.960
horizontal field

195
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.960
okay so there exists a horizontal field

196
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.160
and due to which i'm calling that

197
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.520
electric field as an el

198
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.639
okay so now

199
00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:19.039
as i increase the value of this vds the

200
00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:21.039
field also increases

201
00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:23.360
and due to which what happens is that

202
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.120
the the charge carriers that i have

203
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.639
which is basically an electron

204
00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:29.039
will try to run to the speed of the

205
00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:30.080
field okay

206
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.680
so this drift velocity can be related to

207
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.240
the lateral electric field by the

208
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.199
mobility of

209
00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:39.919
the carriers that i have so in short

210
00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:41.840
based on this classical theory

211
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.240
if at all if i try to plot the electric

212
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.520
field

213
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.800
versus the drift velocity you would find

214
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.840
that

215
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.560
the carriers will try to attain a

216
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.280
specific

217
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.520
drift velocity based on the electric

218
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.880
field that it has

219
00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.560
here and the the slope of this

220
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.400
particular graph would be

221
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.440
equal to mu or mu n that i have written

222
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.080
here

223
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.160
okay higher the voltage that i give the

224
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.000
higher the electric field that exists

225
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.840
and due to which the free carriers

226
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.759
will be drift through the source and the

227
00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:15.199
drain by

228
00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:18.240
a much higher drift velocity clear

229
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.759
so that is the relation that we have for

230
00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:21.440
a longer channel okay

231
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.479
okay so let me write this e l

232
00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:26.319
how do i write this e l in terms of

233
00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:28.800
potential difference

234
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.720
the electric field in terms of vds how

235
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.720
do i write that

236
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.759
minus dou v by dou x yeah so it would be

237
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.440
okay so this is what he's trying to say

238
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.720
and again when we try to look the x

239
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.560
basically stands from here to here the

240
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.840
electric field exists from

241
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.520
a length of 0 all the way to a length of

242
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.520
l okay so due to which it becomes

243
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.759
something like vds

244
00:07:57.759 --> 00:08:00.240
by l the electric field in short could

245
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.599
be written as

246
00:08:01.599 --> 00:08:04.879
v ds by l okay now once we start

247
00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:06.639
reducing the length of the channel okay

248
00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:08.000
whenever i am trying to deal with a

249
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.759
shorter channel the length of this

250
00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:12.240
channel will become small okay and due

251
00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.440
to which the electric field

252
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.599
will be very high even for a small value

253
00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:17.280
of vds

254
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.840
am i right even for a small value of vds

255
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.800
what happens is that

256
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.000
because the length of the channel is

257
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.919
very short the electric field shoots up

258
00:08:23.919 --> 00:08:24.560
to a very

259
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.680
large value okay and as i said

260
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.960
there is something known as a critical

261
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.879
electric field okay

262
00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:34.000
so for even for small value of vds

263
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.760
the electric field across the source in

264
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.080
the drain reaches what is known as

265
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.559
the critical electric field at which the

266
00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:43.039
drift velocity is no more

267
00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.519
given by this expression which is given

268
00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:46.160
as mu

269
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.519
n times that of e l but rather

270
00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:53.600
it would be equal to saturated velocity

271
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.480
okay

272
00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.880
the drift velocity will become saturated

273
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.120
okay and it never follows this relation

274
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.760
which is defined as mu n times that of

275
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.160
e l yeah and that is what we call it as

276
00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.040
a velocity saturation effect now

277
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.680
since because my drift velocity is

278
00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.560
shifted from

279
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.560
being this expression to this expression

280
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.399
okay we will find something different

281
00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:14.959
okay so

282
00:09:14.959 --> 00:09:17.120
i'll talk about this impact when we

283
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.720
discuss about short channel

284
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.480
effect probably in the next class but

285
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.560
today's class let us assume that we are

286
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.399
dealing with a longer term and i just

287
00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:25.279
want to show you

288
00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:26.880
the derivation of this longer channel

289
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.880
current equation okay and later we'll

290
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.640
utilize this derivation

291
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.560
of this long channel into the short

292
00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.080
channel discussion

293
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.360
when we talk about the velocity

294
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.680
saturation effect here pictorially i can

295
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.399
represent this

296
00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:42.640
impact by reaching

297
00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.399
a particular velocity which we called as

298
00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:46.320
a v sat okay

299
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.640
at which the el becomes

300
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.959
ec that is the critical electric field

301
00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:54.320
once i cross this critical electric

302
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:54.800
field

303
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.120
the velocity of our carrier becomes

304
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.800
saturated okay

305
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.040
the drift velocity becomes equal okay

306
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.880
and this is what we call it as a

307
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.200
brush saturation effect okay but today

308
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.279
let me try to con conclude the class

309
00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:08.560
not with the discussion of velocity

310
00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.279
saturation effect but for a long channel

311
00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:14.560
how do we get the current equation

312
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.640
for the current discussion let us assume

313
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.600
that

314
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.440
i am working in the deep triode region

315
00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.079
or deep linear region okay so in this

316
00:10:24.079 --> 00:10:25.200
deep linear region

317
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.640
i am going to assume that the value of

318
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.320
vds is

319
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.000
closer to the value of 0 okay not

320
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.519
exactly equal to 0 but let us assume

321
00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:32.320
that it is so

322
00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.240
small that it can be approximated to the

323
00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.519
value of zero okay

324
00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:37.360
so with that condition let us try to

325
00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.200
evaluate the current that flows between

326
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.320
the source and the drain

327
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.160
and we know that the current i can be

328
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.079
returned as the moment of charge

329
00:10:44.079 --> 00:10:46.480
with respect to the time right so it can

330
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.440
be written as

331
00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.880
dq by dt so charge across the channel

332
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.120
divided by the time okay now

333
00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.040
let us evaluate each of these quantities

334
00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.160
individually okay

335
00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.399
we know this charge q can be written as

336
00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:01.519
c times v

337
00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:03.680
okay now when i look across the

338
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.880
capacitance that i have

339
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.640
it is the total gate capacitance that i

340
00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.959
have okay so it can be the c

341
00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:10.480
quantity can be returned as something

342
00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.279
like coax which has a unit of farad per

343
00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:14.000
meter square

344
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.279
so in order to get the total gate

345
00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:17.440
capacitance i need to multiply

346
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.760
the length and the width of the channel

347
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.519
so due to which i will have this as my

348
00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:22.399
total

349
00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:24.640
capacitance gate capacitance but what is

350
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.720
the effective voltage that gets dropped

351
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.519
across this

352
00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:31.279
channel is it vgs

353
00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:34.480
or is it something like vgc

354
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.560
in order to create the channel i have to

355
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.240
have a gate potential

356
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.760
which is more than the value of vt so

357
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.279
which means that we have to

358
00:11:41.279 --> 00:11:44.399
offset this particular threshold voltage

359
00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:45.920
okay so due to which the effective

360
00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.040
voltage that

361
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.120
appears across this channel would then

362
00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.040
be returned as vgc

363
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.839
okay gate to channel i'm writing okay

364
00:11:55.839 --> 00:11:57.040
minus

365
00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.839
the offset voltage which is dvt okay so

366
00:11:59.839 --> 00:12:01.120
hope that you are clear with this the

367
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.040
effective gate voltage that i have

368
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.760
across this channel is not just vgc but

369
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.519
it has been offsetted by the threshold

370
00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:08.560
voltage and due to which i

371
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.760
write it as vgc minus vth okay now to

372
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.040
create the channel i need

373
00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.079
a minimum of gate to a channel voltage

374
00:12:16.079 --> 00:12:17.519
which is equal to vt so that i am

375
00:12:17.519 --> 00:12:18.639
offsetting it here

376
00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:21.839
okay so now let us talk about

377
00:12:21.839 --> 00:12:24.959
this vgc okay now this vgc can be

378
00:12:24.959 --> 00:12:27.519
written as

379
00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:30.639
vg minus vc right

380
00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:33.839
now what is our channel voltage

381
00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:35.839
this channel voltage is nothing but i

382
00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:37.680
can write it as the average between the

383
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.079
source

384
00:12:38.079 --> 00:12:41.760
and the drain voltage okay so

385
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.839
i'm just going to write this channel

386
00:12:43.839 --> 00:12:45.920
voltage as an average voltage between

387
00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.720
the source and the drain okay

388
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.399
so vg minus vs plus

389
00:12:52.399 --> 00:12:55.600
v d times zero of two

390
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.000
now to this i'm just going to add and

391
00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.839
subtract

392
00:12:59.839 --> 00:13:01.920
the source potential voltages okay so

393
00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.279
when i try to do

394
00:13:03.279 --> 00:13:04.639
what i can do is that you could see that

395
00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:06.399
there is a kind of quantities that you

396
00:13:06.399 --> 00:13:06.720
can

397
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.320
combine okay so you have this quantity

398
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.839
and also have this quantity okay

399
00:13:13.839 --> 00:13:16.240
so both of these things you can combine

400
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:16.880
and you

401
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.839
can create what is known as vgs okay and

402
00:13:19.839 --> 00:13:21.360
then you have you have been left over

403
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.360
with the other two quantities which is

404
00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.399
vds half and this vs

405
00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:28.160
half okay so both of these quantities

406
00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.079
you can write it as vds by

407
00:13:30.079 --> 00:13:34.160
two clear so this vgc

408
00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.480
can be written as v g s minus v d s

409
00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.760
by two here so that concludes the

410
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.680
channel charge now let us try to write

411
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.040
this time

412
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.720
which is nothing but the transit time of

413
00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.560
your carriers between the source and the

414
00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.279
drain

415
00:13:49.279 --> 00:13:51.199
now this transit time can be derived

416
00:13:51.199 --> 00:13:53.120
from what we called as a

417
00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.160
drift velocity okay so since

418
00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.760
the carriers are moving across a length

419
00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.760
of l with a speed of

420
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.959
v d i could write the transit time as

421
00:14:02.959 --> 00:14:06.480
l by v d right now

422
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.760
again we know that this drift velocity

423
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.120
since because we are dealing with the

424
00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.040
longer channel i can use this classical

425
00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.240
formula of mobility times that of the

426
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.720
lateral electric field and again we know

427
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.399
that this lateral electric field

428
00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:23.760
can be returned as vds dirt by the

429
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.160
length

430
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.760
okay so now that when i try to plug in

431
00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.279
all of these quantities

432
00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:29.360
this drift velocity can be returned as

433
00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.480
something like

434
00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.440
mu n times that of radius and this l

435
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.120
will go to the top and what we have is

436
00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.279
something like l square divided by mu

437
00:14:37.279 --> 00:14:40.240
mu n times that of vds okay so now i'm

438
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.360
just going to plug in all of these

439
00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.560
quantities

440
00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.040
for the expression of ideas okay so our

441
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.959
total ideas would then be returned as

442
00:14:46.959 --> 00:14:49.360
something like mu n

443
00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.800
c o x w by l

444
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.600
okay because there is one l term that

445
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.120
sits here so we were cancelling one of

446
00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.639
the else due to which we will end up

447
00:14:58.639 --> 00:15:00.480
having just w by l here

448
00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.760
and then our v g s minus

449
00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.880
v d s by 2 minus

450
00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.000
v d h into

451
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.399
there is one vds that is coming here and

452
00:15:12.399 --> 00:15:14.000
that i will write it here okay

453
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.680
so this is the total expression that we

454
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.040
have and this

455
00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.920
is the current equation in the linear

456
00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:20.720
region

457
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.720
now in order to evaluate the current

458
00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.600
equation in the saturation region

459
00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.720
we know that when the value of vds is

460
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.480
equal to vdsat and that voltage

461
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.320
for a longer channel can be returned as

462
00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.000
vgs minus vt

463
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.839
then this whole of this ids can be

464
00:15:38.839 --> 00:15:40.320
returned

465
00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.839
as saturation current to be equal to

466
00:15:43.839 --> 00:15:47.839
mu n c o x by 2 into

467
00:15:47.839 --> 00:15:50.320
this v g s minus v d the whole square

468
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.000
okay so this is the current equation for

469
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.360
the saturation region and this is the

470
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.000
current equation

471
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.079
for the linear region okay so with this

472
00:15:56.079 --> 00:15:58.320
discussion i'll just stop here

473
00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.759
and these are the current equations for

474
00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:01.759
the longer channel okay so in the next

475
00:16:01.759 --> 00:16:03.519
class i will discuss about how does this

476
00:16:03.519 --> 00:16:04.480
current equation

477
00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.000
gets modified particularly the

478
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.160
saturation current equation

479
00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.399
modifies due to this velocity saturation

480
00:16:10.399 --> 00:16:11.279
effect okay

481
00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:13.279
so we'll talk about this how does this

482
00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:15.040
current equation gets modified

483
00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.199
when i have this saturation effect in

484
00:16:17.199 --> 00:16:18.720
the next class okay

485
00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:23.839
so i'll just stop here
