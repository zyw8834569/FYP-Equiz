00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.559
hello everybody in this video I am gonna

2
00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.150
show you how to design an X nor gate out

3
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.689
of C Mon so here's a introduction the

4
00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:27.730
symbol for an X nor gate looks like this

5
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.179
the truth table if we take the two

6
00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:56.570
inputs a and B looks like this 1 0 0 1

7
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:06.080
and the equation is a following so this

8
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.610
is how xnor gate looks like so the most

9
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.620
important thing is to utilize this

10
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.420
equation because this has been a very

11
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:23.630
very important so let's now focus to

12
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.820
write down our pull-up network and our

13
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:36.050
pulldown network and then write down the

14
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.500
equations for each of them so for a

15
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.920
pull-up what we basically do is apply

16
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.310
the inverse of this equation so we have

17
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.670
a times B so what we have is the inverse

18
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.910
of a plus because there's a dot here the

19
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.710
inverse B so we have inverse of a plus

20
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.030
inverse of B

21
00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.210
and then for this we apply the same

22
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.780
concept but this time since there's

23
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.769
already an inverse theirs won't be in

24
00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.360
the pull-up network session so we have a

25
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.880
and then we have B here and then one

26
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.280
have an plus sign and then here we're

27
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.510
going to group them together by the

28
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.900
inverse in which we get this dot right

29
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.260
here and for a pulldown it's really

30
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.150
really easy it's simply the same thing

31
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:48.860
the same equation now let's draw our

32
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.430
CMOS circuit so now what we know our

33
00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:06.139
pull-up or pulldown let's write down our

34
00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:08.739
equations

35
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.890
so let's first draw our pull out network

36
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:34.950
circuit so we have VDD and right here

37
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.080
I'm gonna draw this circuit right here

38
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.810
and then let's draw our circuit here a

39
00:03:51.810 --> 00:04:04.590
plus B and then since there's a and

40
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.230
state here we're gonna connect them in

41
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.260
series like this so there's our pull-up

42
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:19.260
network and I'll pull down Network we

43
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.959
have a times B so we have that in series

44
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.810
and then we have this in series again

45
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.599
but both this time both a and B is an

46
00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:38.990
inverse

47
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.610
and then finally here if you have our

48
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.300
zero output and then our hi so excuse me

49
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.660
so this is low and this is high and this

50
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.670
is our here's our output now here is our

51
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.410
CMOS circuit but we're not done yet

52
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.530
because this is not how an X knowing X

53
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.210
nor gate works as you know that this is

54
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.310
how the X nor gate works is with these

55
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.330
following outputs this truth table but

56
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.660
the problem is is that this doesn't

57
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.570
match it so what we need to do is we

58
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.030
simply just have to apply an inverter to

59
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.970
it and this will operate like an X nor

60
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:45.310
gate so it's just draw an inverter here

61
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.250
[Music]

62
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.400
and there we go that's our xnor gate

63
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.680
hope you guys get a snapshot of this

64
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.540
just in case if you guys want to use

65
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:16.980
this for your homework well anyways

66
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.750
thank you guys so much for watching and

67
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.800
I will see you next time
