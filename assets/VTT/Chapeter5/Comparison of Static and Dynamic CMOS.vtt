00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.800
welcome to vlsi lecture series i

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.240
professor it is dulakia

3
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.399
is going to explain you comparison of

4
00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:09.599
static and dynamic cmos in this video

5
00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.880
so when we talk about static cmos then

6
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.360
in its static cmos structure you will be

7
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.320
finding here we have vdd

8
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.520
after that we have pull

9
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.080
up network which is made up of pmos

10
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.119
that can have k inputs

11
00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.600
then we have pull down network

12
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.520
and this pull down network that is made

13
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.680
up of nmos

14
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.440
that can have k inputs this is connected

15
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.840
to ground

16
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.200
and here we take output

17
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.879
so this is the basic structure which is

18
00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.039
there with static cmos

19
00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.920
as if we talk about dynamic cmos

20
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.960
structure

21
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.079
then here we have vdd after that we have

22
00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.559
pmos with gated clock

23
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.400
then we have pull down network

24
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.159
and in pull down network we have nmos

25
00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.560
with n with k inputs

26
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.320
after that we have another gated clock

27
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.200
and mass then we have ground over here

28
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.360
and here we have output and there can be

29
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.640
load capacitance cl over here

30
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.560
so these are the basic structure which

31
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.560
is there with static cmos and dynamic

32
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.000
cmos

33
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.119
now if you observe how many transistors

34
00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.399
are there

35
00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.920
then you see in static cmos if we talk

36
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.360
about

37
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.280
nmos then nmos is made up of

38
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.759
pull down network so that there are k

39
00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.320
inputs so we can say there can be k

40
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.399
number of nmos and if we talk about pmos

41
00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.440
then pull up network is made up of pmos

42
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.560
so with k input there can be k

43
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.239
number of pmos and

44
00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.440
as if we talk about dynamic cmos

45
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.520
then in that if we calculate total

46
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.040
number of nmos

47
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.200
then with this k number of inputs with

48
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.680
this pull down network there can be k

49
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.680
n mass plus one gated clock

50
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.920
nmos is there and if we talk about pmos

51
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.519
then only one gated clock pmos is there

52
00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.239
so number of transistors that is less in

53
00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.440
dynamic cmos

54
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.640
and major effect

55
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.519
that is there because of pmos pmos is

56
00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:50.239
less as

57
00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.760
pmos size is more here static cmos

58
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.400
circuit

59
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.440
is having larger size that one can say

60
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.200
right and here you can say

61
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.000
in dynamic cmos only one pmos is there

62
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.040
so size

63
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.159
of dynamic cmos that will be less

64
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.840
now when we talk about capacitive

65
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.560
loading then capacitive loading

66
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.000
that is happening more due to pmos

67
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.519
as pmo size is more right so in static

68
00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.080
cmos

69
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.120
capacitive loading will be more and in

70
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.239
dynamic cmos

71
00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.360
only one pmos is there so capacitive

72
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.000
loading

73
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.560
is less

74
00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.159
and one more thing that i can say

75
00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:42.239
because of more pmos which is there in

76
00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:42.720
this

77
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.440
static cmos switching characteristic is

78
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.480
slower

79
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.959
while due to only one pmos is there in

80
00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.239
dynamic cmos

81
00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.000
switching characteristic is faster

82
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.920
now there are some disadvantages which

83
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.000
is there with dynamic cmos

84
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.400
see when we connect dynamic cmos in

85
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.200
cascading

86
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.040
at that time there is a possibility of

87
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.400
false operation

88
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.400
so there are cascading issues which is

89
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.319
there in dynamics

90
00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.120
cmos and those cascading issues that is

91
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.760
not there

92
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.799
in static cmos

93
00:04:20.238 --> 00:04:23.840
now when we see operation of

94
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.880
dynamic cmos then it is compulsory to

95
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.600
have pre-charged by this gated clock

96
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.320
while that pre-charge is not required in

97
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.600
static cmos

98
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.600
so in dynamic cmos we need to have

99
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.720
pre-charge

100
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.040
for operation and in static cmos we

101
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.840
don't need pre-charge for operation

102
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.720
if you see my previous videos based on

103
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.880
dynamic cmos and static cmos

104
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.479
then in dynamic cmos i have told

105
00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:57.120
when you have output is equals to logic

106
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.840
1

107
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.240
at that time output stays in high

108
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.680
impedance mode

109
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.120
right while over here in static cmos

110
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.919
as if you have output is equals to logic

111
00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:08.400
1

112
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.160
then it does not have high impedance

113
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.680
mode right and

114
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.240
because of that you will be finding

115
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.880
output

116
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.759
is equals to logic 1 in dynamic cmos

117
00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:19.039
affected by

118
00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.639
noise with larger extent right

119
00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.160
so noise immunity is lower

120
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.960
in case of dynamic cmos compared to

121
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.919
static cmos

122
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.600
now when we talk about working of

123
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.160
dynamic

124
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.759
cmos then in its working

125
00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:44.080
if you observe my previous videos then i

126
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.440
have explained

127
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.759
because of charge sharing there is a

128
00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:48.880
leakage of charge

129
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.000
which happens in dynamic cmos while

130
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.800
leakage of charge that does not happens

131
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.919
in static cmos

132
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.919
so if you see overall comparison

133
00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:07.440
then dynamic cmos is faster it is

134
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.240
there with lower switching time

135
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.600
characteristic

136
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.240
as well as capacitive loading effect is

137
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.199
less

138
00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:18.400
and size of circuit is small as if we

139
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.319
talk about static cmos

140
00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:23.759
then it is slower in its

141
00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:26.479
switching characteristic because of more

142
00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:27.840
number of pmos

143
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.840
as well as it is having higher loading

144
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.560
capacitance because of pmos structure

145
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.800
and its size is even large compared to

146
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.240
dynamic cmos

147
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.520
but this static cmos does not have

148
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.479
issues of cascading and leakage of

149
00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:43.840
capacitance

150
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.639
while that is there with dynamic cmos so

151
00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:48.400
this is how comparison is there with

152
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.639
static cmos and dynamic cmos

153
00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:52.160
i hope that you have understood this

154
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.319
video thank you so much for watching

155
00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:54.880

please do give your valuable suggestions

157
00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:58.080

158
00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.680
to me and based on that in future

159
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.120
i'll be making videos which will be
