1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
so in our last videos we have seen

2
00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.680
different techniques which can be used

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.610
to design our CMOS logic which included

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.730
the most like pseudo n MOS tri-state

5
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.179
circuits and grata CMOS circuits now in

6
00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.359
this session we talked about technique

7
00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.970
which is known as the dynamic CMOS logic

8
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.320
circuits the dynamic CMOS logic circuits

9
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.580
based on the concept where it operates

10
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.820
in two to two modes the first mode is

11
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.940
like it is a it is a charting state or

12
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.610
it is also known as a pre charging shape

13
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.270
when our p MOS is on and all n MOS is

14
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.260
off like it charges the output capacitor

15
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.809
here and the other one is our evaluation

16
00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.300
phase where it made the capacitor

17
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.430
discharge so so Makassar thing can

18
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.489
emerge pre charging circuit like pre

19
00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.699
charging both more the operation

20
00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.290
activate about the hedge of minus 5

21
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.710
signals I have a zero if we see here you

22
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.400
know it here for this dynamic CMOS logic

23
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.460
circuits so ISTA muhammara positive 5

24
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.159
signal here he basically is an Moscow or

25
00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.009
is for AP motion control Quran it's

26
00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.250
Emma's Co like Java file signal 0 over

27
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.610
to this and mostly be in cutoff so it is

28
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.020
it is turned off and Phi 0 means this P

29
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.140
Mo's will be turned on if this beam was

30
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.409
turned on it will like it is it is a

31
00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.390
short circuit here in the current will

32
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.570
flow to all this path here and it will

33
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.570
charge T C out like it which are the

34
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.090
output chemists er so it means that our

35
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.500
output is pre-charged VDD value on and

36
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.950
that is true or MP cobalt and P the

37
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.520
transistor so this this is known as a

38
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.210
pre charge P charge state when our Phi

39
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.719
level is 0 here and it charges the

40
00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.169
output capacitor the next phase is known

41
00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.870
as the evaluation phase in this space

42
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.800
like

43
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.770
when Phi is equal to one it means that

44
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.940
this n Mo's is now this n Mo's is no

45
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.410
turn on and this beam was off so what

46
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.930
will happen is this capacitor can

47
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.820
discharge through this enfant volume so

48
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.600
I mean has a tank a large capacitor will

49
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.450
discharge hose at I through this in fact

50
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.350
because this this part is not clear

51
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.730
licking your issue have we okay this

52
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.820
discharging depends on or input inputs

53
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.050
like B a B and C inputs so our inputs

54
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.030
control whether the output will be

55
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.970
discharged or not for example in a case

56
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.420
when like a is equal to 1 B is equal to

57
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.150
1 and C is not like fee is equal to 0

58
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.060
then this path is not clear for

59
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.670
discharging so this the output will not

60
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.510
discharge and here the output dependence

61
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.720
represents the D state of all this n

62
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.520
Mo's here because if all if all these

63
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.940
inputs are 1 and then output will be

64
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.120
discharged to a to 0 so it means that

65
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.220
this this represents of rally dot would

66
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.320
know so what problem we have for this

67
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.440
type of circuits this this beauty issue

68
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.320
is known as the a charge hearing and

69
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.820
charge sharing means like in case there

70
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.060
is no path present to this ground here -

71
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.450
like through this end was the enfant ROG

72
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.350
X and this n MOS to ground so if there

73
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.110
is no path available that directly

74
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.680
connects these two bound in that case

75
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.560
the charge is shared between the nodes

76
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.640
here for example if you see here in this

77
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.880
circuit we have designed a logic which

78
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.220
is known as an end gate like this

79
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.560
circuit here this represents a NAND gate

80
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.880
logic if we observe that the second uses

81
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.400
less transistors than static CMOS like

82
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.660
this

83
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.600
this logic implements our language but

84
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.630
if you have seen earlier three input

85
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.880
NAND gate uses mode number of

86
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.980
transistors as compared to this one this

87
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.250
one because we have pulldown network and

88
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.710
we have we had earlier a pull-up network

89
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.830
agent 3 and most are required for

90
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.230
pulldown network and 3 P Mo's are

91
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.440
required for our pull-up network so this

92
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.210
uses less number of resistors and

93
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.120
obviously if if we are using less number

94
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.310
of transistors the area consumption is

95
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.960
also reduced and the fall time and can

96
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.850
be reduced by increasing the size of

97
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.630
like of infant's this is this is what we

98
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.820
have been certain earlier like if you if

99
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.980
you want to reduce the fall time or if

100
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.020
you want to do is reduce the rise time

101
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.020
then you have to basically increase the

102
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.630
size of almost nodes

103
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.760
let us consider this example here of

104
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.060
this NAND gate and we basically we will

105
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.310
understand how this charge is shedding

106
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.670
happen between the nodes here like if we

107
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.330
consider a point here and then we have a

108
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.910
charge a node here and then we have

109
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.010
third node here at point like this

110
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.600
disjunction so let us let us make some

111
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.270
delegations and we understand what the

112
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.100
charge sharing means and how it affects

113
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:56.130
odd or more sorts and in dynamic CMOS

114
00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.890
logic circuits we have to tackle the

115
00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.540
issue of charge sharing like in our

116
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:13.550
these dynamic CMOS logic we have Livity

117
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.560
charge shading issue we have seen

118
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.040
earlier like our charge the kids reduces

119
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.920
the output voltage that was hand on our

120
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.190
output node but another problem occurs

121
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.070
when our fine signal is fun like we are

122
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.810
not considering a case when our Phi

123
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.360
signal was 0 and our N Mo's was turned

124
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.960
on so that there was no path to be down

125
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.610
so we are considering

126
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.120
our clock signal Y is equal to 1 this

127
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.530
means our like if we have this down

128
00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:57.240
network and we had this case here like

129
00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.270
this 5 is equal to 1 it means there is

130
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.710
no direct parent there is no direct

131
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:07.949
demos but we have our direct current it

132
00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:11.100
is N Mo's and this is going on so the

133
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.470
current we are assuming like the current

134
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:17.130
can be discharged through this point but

135
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.820
there would be a charge like sharing

136
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.010
because of the parasitic load of esters

137
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.139
for example we are we were considering a

138
00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:31.260
case where we have designed a set it

139
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.979
somewhat like this one here we have

140
00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:38.400
three inputs pulldown network then we

141
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.880
have n Mo's which is basically connected

142
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.970
to our 5 5 which is equal to 1 in this

143
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:49.260
case we have these three inputs and we

144
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.630
have our output node registered that is

145
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:59.220
present here so this is our C out this

146
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.530
is our V out that is this really

147
00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:06.539
positive and negative so there are two

148
00:08:06.539 --> 00:08:08.550
different node capacitors present like

149
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:14.180
one node capacitor is is present here

150
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.729
this is our first mode professor the

151
00:08:17.729 --> 00:08:20.099
second node capacitor appears on this

152
00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:24.780
point like this is our second node

153
00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.900
capacitor this is known as with C 1 this

154
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:31.110
is known as a C 2 so the capacitor we

155
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.659
have we have two different capacitors C

156
00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:39.958
1 and C 2 these two are our load

157
00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.559
capacitance

158
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.260
and obviously be corresponding were to

159
00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:51.070
use all we want and we do on these on

160
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:55.240
these capacitors so we assume that at

161
00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:00.130
time at T is equal to 0 Phi is equal to

162
00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:04.450
1 it means that this portion of our

163
00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:10.570
circuit like this portion here this is

164
00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:14.170
in cutoff like all the moss is in cutoff

165
00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:17.920
and obviously there is no direct path

166
00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.200
between VDD and Z out so that the

167
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:24.040
capacitor may get charged so we as you

168
00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:29.110
we can assume at time T is equal to 0 we

169
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.470
out was actually this is represented as

170
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:38.530
we out of 0 this is charged at we are

171
00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:41.800
assuming that it is such value and we

172
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.910
also assume the voltage is at V 1 and V

173
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:50.830
2 are 0 they are not charged charged and

174
00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:53.770
the voltage is the voltage V 0 at this

175
00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:57.460
time like at this time T is equal to 0

176
00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.490
we can say that the charge that is

177
00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:04.360
present at this Q this see how it is

178
00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:09.220
represented by Q is equal to VDD and C

179
00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:13.600
out so this is all maximum charge so the

180
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.210
worst case of our chart chaining occurs

181
00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.390
when our input voltages are set somewhat

182
00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:25.600
like is equal to 1 B is equal to 1 and C

183
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.690
is equal to 0 this means there is no

184
00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:31.870
direct path between our like this is

185
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:35.110
this one is our in cutoff region this

186
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:37.810
MOSFET here if this is in cutoff region

187
00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:39.790
so there is no direct path between

188
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:43.210
between our output node this node and on

189
00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:48.720
ground that appears here so in this case

190
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.250
there is no direct discharge until

191
00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.130
account but there will be some

192
00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.949
discharging through C 1 and C 2

193
00:10:57.949 --> 00:11:02.839
so in ideal case what we want is but

194
00:11:02.839 --> 00:11:07.079
what we want is that the output voltage

195
00:11:07.079 --> 00:11:09.750
should remain high but that will not be

196
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:13.529
the case because we have our the node

197
00:11:13.529 --> 00:11:16.470
capacitances which are C 1 and C 2 so

198
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:20.430
the current will flow out of our output

199
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:24.740
capacitor because like because our C out

200
00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.540
V out is higher as compared to V 1 and V

201
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:31.139
2 so the charge that flows out of all

202
00:11:31.139 --> 00:11:33.389
capacitor can be represented by like

203
00:11:33.389 --> 00:11:36.569
this entity presented by I and we can

204
00:11:36.569 --> 00:11:39.990
say that when this current flows V out

205
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:43.050
will decrease and while the voltage is

206
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.170
at C 1 here and C 2 here will increase

207
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:50.009
and this will continue until we really

208
00:11:50.009 --> 00:11:52.709
get our voltage level at V equal to V

209
00:11:52.709 --> 00:11:55.139
out is equal to V 1 which is equal to V

210
00:11:55.139 --> 00:11:59.420
2 and this will be our final value and

211
00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:03.120
the total charge can be written as like

212
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.220
the total charge Q this can be written

213
00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:12.420
as C out the F plus C 1 V F and plus C 2

214
00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.029
V F because we have VF s final value on

215
00:12:15.029 --> 00:12:19.560
all all terminals so this will be equal

216
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:24.680
to C out plus C 1 plus C 2 and V F and

217
00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.430
if we know that the during the principle

218
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:32.490
of charge conservation this must be

219
00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.620
equal to an initial charge like this is

220
00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.779
our final charge this must be equal to

221
00:12:36.779 --> 00:12:38.970
our initial charge this initial charge

222
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:43.560
was C out VDD so if we equate these two

223
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:50.579
expressions over here we will get we

224
00:12:50.579 --> 00:12:56.639
will get C out VDD which is equal to C

225
00:12:56.639 --> 00:13:01.769
out plus C 1 plus C 2 and this will be F

226
00:13:01.769 --> 00:13:04.319
now we have to solve this expression for

227
00:13:04.319 --> 00:13:06.449
V F because we want to know the final

228
00:13:06.449 --> 00:13:11.070
value this will be equal to C out the

229
00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:16.020
by three out plus c1 plus c2 and this is

230
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:21.540
multiplied by VDD and looking at this

231
00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.960
expression here we can say that the G

232
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.970
term this term here this term here is

233
00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:32.760
less than one because here we have C out

234
00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.010
and we're here we have our addition here

235
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:38.760
in Co so we can say using this

236
00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.770
expression we actually be less than

237
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:44.190
equal to will be less than so it reduces

238
00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:47.400
the overall output voltage the effect of

239
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.660
charge chain can be like reduced by this

240
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.030
discharge hearing effect can be read you

241
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:58.830
will try see out if CC out is greater

242
00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:02.070
than greater than C 1 plus C 2 so then

243
00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:05.520
we may ignore this expression if we make

244
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.420
no ignore this expression like the F

245
00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:12.330
would be approximately equal to this

246
00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:16.740
would be approximately equal to D so we

247
00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.830
can say we can approximate the final

248
00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:23.190
value to VD D but that may not be an

249
00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.590
easy task it is difficult to achieve the

250
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:28.170
capacitor values because they are

251
00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:31.830
dependent on the layout sizes so it is

252
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.380
difficult to design a capacitor that

253
00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.350
satisfies our requirements for our final

254
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:40.980
voltages in charge shiri so this was our

255
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:46.890
discussion for charge sharing so we have

256
00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:49.350
seen that how charge sharing effects the

257
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:51.570
MOSFETs and and the operation of this

258
00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:55.860
that modes with so an advanced version

259
00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.410
of this dynamic CMOS logic circuits is

260
00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:01.050
known as the dominant logic in this

261
00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:04.050
domain of logic circuit it adds an

262
00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:06.750
inverter to the output like we had seen

263
00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:09.810
this see this circuit here earlier this

264
00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:12.000
circuit represents V this circuit

265
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.060
basically represents the the dynamic

266
00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:17.550
CMOS logic circuit but we add an

267
00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:20.790
inverter at the output when we add an

268
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:24.120
inverter at the output and

269
00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.999
we have we can see that when our Phi is

270
00:15:26.999 --> 00:15:31.680
equal to zero it means like CX the

271
00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.959
output capacitor will be charged to

272
00:15:33.959 --> 00:15:37.620
really like - it will be charged through

273
00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:41.459
this point and obviously or we can say

274
00:15:41.459 --> 00:15:44.009
that if this is charged to VDD the our

275
00:15:44.009 --> 00:15:47.879
output will be zero but during the

276
00:15:47.879 --> 00:15:50.579
evaluation phase we have this Phi is

277
00:15:50.579 --> 00:15:53.639
equal to 1 like this input this Phi set

278
00:15:53.639 --> 00:15:56.610
it is equal to 1 if this is 1 this means

279
00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:59.879
that this as n was will be on so this is

280
00:15:59.879 --> 00:16:01.980
the same logic way that we have talked

281
00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.769
about earlier but what happens at this

282
00:16:04.769 --> 00:16:08.730
CX chemists are the F this is 1 our

283
00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:11.970
output remains high and if our output

284
00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:14.670
events hide obviously that depends on

285
00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:18.029
our a ence serie points if our output

286
00:16:18.029 --> 00:16:22.079
events high are like V out will be equal

287
00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:25.680
to 0 but in case when this goes to 0

288
00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.100
through this through this like this part

289
00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:33.089
here then C X will be 0 and our V out

290
00:16:33.089 --> 00:16:36.569
will be like Vinny so this basically

291
00:16:36.569 --> 00:16:40.399
represents non-inverting logic circuit

292
00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:43.259
because we have seen that these dynamic

293
00:16:43.259 --> 00:16:45.300
CMOS represents our inverted logic

294
00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:49.620
because we have implemented for example

295
00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:52.290
we can see that if we have to implement

296
00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:54.689
and engage using dynamic CMOS logic

297
00:16:54.689 --> 00:16:58.499
circuits we just have to add inverter at

298
00:16:58.499 --> 00:17:01.499
the output and similarly if we have to

299
00:17:01.499 --> 00:17:04.020
apply an or gate we just have to apply

300
00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.439
our like a not gate at the outputs

301
00:17:07.439 --> 00:17:11.279
output point here so this dynamic CMOS

302
00:17:11.279 --> 00:17:14.640
lower the time dynamic so the sorry is

303
00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.789
the dominant logic circuits represents

304
00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:23.549
the non-inverting logic and the extended

305
00:17:23.549 --> 00:17:26.130
version of this Domino logic circuit

306
00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:28.860
says dominocus gate circuits in this

307
00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.169
domain of cascade circuits we just add

308
00:17:31.169 --> 00:17:35.280
up multiple stages here and all that all

309
00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.100
the on all the stages we

310
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:41.270
we kept a stir here and all in all these

311
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:44.930
stages and we have an inverter almost

312
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.380
ages have same fire obviously

313
00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.540
controlling signal defy signal is same

314
00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:54.170
for all these base stages and during the

315
00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:56.870
speed P charge state like when alpha is

316
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:59.780
equal to zero this this basically is

317
00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.750
turned on all these MOSFETs here these

318
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:05.210
are turned on if these more through most

319
00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:07.790
nuts are on it means that the capacitors

320
00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:10.820
will be charged to a voltage so all

321
00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:14.510
these capacitors c1 c2 and c3 here all

322
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.210
these are charged to our maximum value

323
00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:21.260
that is VDD and all our outputs like f1

324
00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.830
we have a 2 we have a 3 all these values

325
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:29.480
are 0 so what happens in the evaluation

326
00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.480
phase like in evaluation phase 5 will be

327
00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.450
equal to 1 that means that the chain

328
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:38.060
reaction can like the chain goes in

329
00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.280
devaluation fits like this this whole

330
00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:43.060
chain here this goes in evaluation phase

331
00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:47.030
so this is known as a chain reaction

332
00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:49.910
that starts from state's first stage to

333
00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:54.800
deal to the last one it means that this

334
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.320
reaction like this is this point here

335
00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.680
this stays one here if this is charged

336
00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.670
then it will start like depending on

337
00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:08.180
this input head it will go to 0 if this

338
00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.790
is this growth goes to 0 it means that

339
00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:14.390
this point goes 1 is this goes to 1 it

340
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.340
means this part is clear now and this

341
00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:20.450
can go to 0 as well so if this goes to 0

342
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:23.120
like this this current starts to open

343
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.820
from here on from this part here the

344
00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:29.000
output will draw up to like the drop to

345
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.720
VDD so if this is 1 it means this is now

346
00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.480
clear this is now conducting and this

347
00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.750
stage can also go to 0 and the output of

348
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:43.520
3 can go to 1 so yeah how a chain

349
00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.100
reaction and just made the first States

350
00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:49.130
is hot water or like depending on the

351
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:50.169
condition of our

352
00:19:50.169 --> 00:19:53.109
was first stage how are you eh a chain

353
00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:54.879
reaction basically is that a semana

354
00:19:54.879 --> 00:19:58.779
pasada as this is indicated here like

355
00:19:58.779 --> 00:20:01.869
chain reaction Joey can be broken like

356
00:20:01.869 --> 00:20:04.330
King the kingpin March and it syndrome

357
00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:07.359
would start like stop who supplier if

358
00:20:07.359 --> 00:20:12.460
one of like stages remains high other

359
00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.779
disease situation man like for example

360
00:20:15.779 --> 00:20:19.119
multiple hompage you the stage right

361
00:20:19.119 --> 00:20:21.460
over the past input head at this point

362
00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.369
here you know my input is zero here

363
00:20:24.369 --> 00:20:27.100
appear so it means even to the point I

364
00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.440
get discharged hanging order even though

365
00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:33.279
these two are discharged algorithm is up

366
00:20:33.279 --> 00:20:35.440
and tomorrow even a point so that he is

367
00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.359
go discharging more than ever so it

368
00:20:37.359 --> 00:20:39.940
means that this stage when is high of

369
00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:43.480
yes raise hurry a change in Hiyori so it

370
00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.239
means this this chain reaction can be

371
00:20:46.239 --> 00:20:49.929
broken depending on the condition of one

372
00:20:49.929 --> 00:20:53.470
stage so it's a stage give it as a chain

373
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:56.950
reaction so control care after that can

374
00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:00.009
be stopped so there are some limitations

375
00:21:00.009 --> 00:21:02.320
for this domino cascade performance

376
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.499
first condition is don't you know logic

377
00:21:05.499 --> 00:21:08.259
gates are specifically used in obviously

378
00:21:08.259 --> 00:21:11.440
knee gaskets so the other thing is

379
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:14.080
double cascade must have evaluation

380
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.359
interval large enough like for example

381
00:21:16.359 --> 00:21:19.269
this variation interval if this

382
00:21:19.269 --> 00:21:22.359
evolution interval is not large then one

383
00:21:22.359 --> 00:21:25.539
stage can against against stand to de

384
00:21:25.539 --> 00:21:28.149
maximum value so this stage cannot fall

385
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:30.820
if this stage does not fall the next

386
00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.940
stage for like these stage for if we

387
00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.909
have it here that will remain high as

388
00:21:36.909 --> 00:21:40.779
well so if we want all stages to fall it

389
00:21:40.779 --> 00:21:44.109
means that all it means that the

390
00:21:44.109 --> 00:21:46.690
evaluation interval must be large so

391
00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:49.929
this that will allow all stages to

392
00:21:49.929 --> 00:21:53.499
discharge or all we can say that the

393
00:21:53.499 --> 00:21:57.249
output will propagate from hours from

394
00:21:57.249 --> 00:22:01.690
stage one to the to the last stage so

395
00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:02.739
what factors

396
00:22:02.739 --> 00:22:03.220
limit

397
00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.039
this evaluation interval like we have

398
00:22:06.039 --> 00:22:08.830
seen earlier there are two different

399
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:12.610
like problems one is known as charge

400
00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:14.200
sharing and the other one is known as

401
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.100
charge leakage

402
00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.590
these two are limiting factors which

403
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:20.770
basically basically affect the interval

404
00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:24.100
of evaluation phase to overcome the

405
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:27.490
issue of shorter evaluation intervals

406
00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:30.400
charge deeper circuits are used for

407
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.620
example we have a single f-18 charged

408
00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:36.460
capacitor adhere what was he up ap Moses

409
00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.890
okay measure Graham's exam she collected

410
00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:42.789
if this PMO's is down it means care

411
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:45.309
about a path see each of cxi a heavy

412
00:22:45.309 --> 00:22:48.700
shot charged a Giga gay drop thing about

413
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.280
scepter through leakage current how one

414
00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.440
first two conditions and Jamison who had

415
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.090
a posse eight to see exhale you

416
00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:58.059
discharged receptor a condition in NK

417
00:22:58.059 --> 00:22:59.679
multiple benefits sorry

418
00:22:59.679 --> 00:23:01.600
turned on no sign on a value PASOK path

419
00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.179
he has a pungent okay is co-op a

420
00:23:04.179 --> 00:23:06.669
optimist ground paths a linker today or

421
00:23:06.669 --> 00:23:09.429
tomorrow capacitor discharge water so it

422
00:23:09.429 --> 00:23:11.860
means there is a large current that will

423
00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.980
flow from this path and the other case

424
00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:18.280
is when are like one of our n words and

425
00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:22.539
n FET is thing in cutoff region and that

426
00:23:22.539 --> 00:23:25.330
basically limitlessly the flow of

427
00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:28.240
current through this path so in that

428
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.700
case the charge shading and charge

429
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.700
linkage will occur it means there's a

430
00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.940
minut current that will flow from this

431
00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:40.240
path to two grounds obviously that that

432
00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.909
that is basically the charge sharing and

433
00:23:42.909 --> 00:23:46.419
charge leakage to tackle that minut

434
00:23:46.419 --> 00:23:49.840
current this and this week p MOS is used

435
00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:54.150
so that it can keep discharge here and

436
00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:57.309
the other technique that is used to

437
00:23:57.309 --> 00:24:00.669
charge to basically to charge these two

438
00:24:00.669 --> 00:24:03.490
people is charge here is use an inverter

439
00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:06.130
here like we use this inversion here so

440
00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:09.010
that it turns on this PMO's and then the

441
00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:12.070
charge basically will stay on what

442
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:14.260
happens in case when this circuit

443
00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:17.170
discharges from this pub

444
00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:19.600
okay you sir tomorrow is parts it is

445
00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.270
Jahjaga so it means by a passing you

446
00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:25.660
just see Excel pellet VDD Petra - yup

447
00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:29.440
discharged philosopher when this this v

448
00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:34.300
VX basically er CX discharges it means r

449
00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.810
VX goes low a girl must react slo-moes I

450
00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:41.830
get it means this not gate is now the

451
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:45.190
output of this not gate is 1 and this P

452
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:47.800
motion will be turned off so it means

453
00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.160
there is no link between this people say

454
00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:55.630
so we don't want we don't we don't need

455
00:24:55.630 --> 00:25:00.220
to have a strong the weaker emos so a

456
00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.140
multiple see half a charge keeper

457
00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.990
circuit was India vector okay I'm on a

458
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.530
charge

459
00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:08.740
Oh Likud's charge shading or charge Lee

460
00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.770
it's a drop hanging on Agatha or hamari

461
00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:14.380
voltage go holder time unless can while

462
00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.540
passive allopath clear / he has it

463
00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:22.030
discharging sword mother so this was it

464
00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:25.150
for our dynamic CMOS logic circuits we

465
00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:28.500
have seen two different types one is non

466
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.000
dynamic CMOS logic circuits and the

467
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.760
other one is all domino cascade perform

468
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.490
again the domino cascade circuits and we

469
00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:39.130
have also seen that how our charge

470
00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:41.910
keeper circuits can be used to basically

471
00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:45.960
to keep the charge at our output nodes

472
00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:49.600
so I will name you have it and with a

473
00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.350
practice exercise it says that draw a

474
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:56.380
circuit diagram for dynamic logic gate

475
00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.230
so like you have to use the dynamic CMOS

476
00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:03.340
logic and obviously using minimum number

477
00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.890
of transistors so obviously if there is

478
00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:08.380
a option to simplify this expression you

479
00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:12.340
have to do that and the function is

480
00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:15.900
given here you you just have to draw

481
00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.420
dynamic CMOS logic gate of this

482
00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:22.450
expression here so that's it for this

483
00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:26.460
session I will see you next session
