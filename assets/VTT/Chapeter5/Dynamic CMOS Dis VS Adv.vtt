00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:02.879
welcome to vlsi lecture series i

2
00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.640
professor it is dulakia is going to

3
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.600
explain you

4
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.639
dynamic cmos in this video and there are

5
00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.160
some advantages which is there with

6
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.360
dynamic cmos over

7
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.679
static cmos that we will discuss it

8
00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:14.559
later

9
00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.400
let me explain you the basic circuit

10
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.160
structure which is there with dynamic

11
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.359
cmos first

12
00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.840
so in its circuit structure first we

13
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.400
have vdd supply over here

14
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.599
after that there is pmos which is

15
00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.320
gated clock pmos so here we give clock

16
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.238
signal to this pmos

17
00:00:32.238 --> 00:00:35.680
after that there is pull down network

18
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.239
and this pull down network that is made

19
00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:38.879
up of

20
00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.399
nmos let us say this is having some

21
00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.800
boolean function which is having

22
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.920
inputs and those inputs are k number of

23
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.120
inputs

24
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.399
after that there is another

25
00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.760
nmos gated clock and mos so here

26
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.320
we have nmos that is of gated clock and

27
00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.359
mos

28
00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.320
and in this we take output from this

29
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.120
terminal

30
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.438
and that we can connect it to any other

31
00:01:05.438 --> 00:01:06.960
digital circuit

32
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.280
and with that if i say my load

33
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.799
capacitance

34
00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.360
that is cl then this is what basic

35
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.200
structure which is there with dynamic

36
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.640
cmos

37
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.920
now i'll explain you how

38
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.799
circuit wise this dynamic cmos is better

39
00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.720
compared to static cmos

40
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.600
so if you observe static cmos structure

41
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.960
then

42
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.240
in static cmos structure we were been

43
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.799
having

44
00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.159
vdd supply after that

45
00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.799
there was pull up network

46
00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.799
that is having pmos let us say

47
00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.640
inputs are there and those inputs are

48
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.079
k number of inputs after that there was

49
00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:52.479
pull

50
00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.159
down network and in pull down network

51
00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.159
we've been having nmos and again

52
00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.240
with this pull down network we have

53
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.759
k number of inputs and after that we

54
00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:08.000
have

55
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.800
ground and we were been taking output

56
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.720
from this terminal

57
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.200
so that is how static cmos structure

58
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.879
that we have seen

59
00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.520
now here let us compare this to

60
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.720
structure

61
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.599
with respect to number of transistors so

62
00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:24.560
if you observe

63
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.840
dynamic cmos in that if you calculate

64
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.239
total number of pmos

65
00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.360
then you see in this total

66
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.720
one pmos is there and if you calculate

67
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.879
total number of nmos

68
00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.680
then you see k number of input nmos is

69
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.360
there plus 1

70
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.640
clocked nmos is there so total k

71
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.080
plus 1 number of nmos are there right

72
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.640
and as if you talk about static cmos

73
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.360
number of

74
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.879
transistors in that case you see pull up

75
00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.040
network is there with pmos

76
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.599
so as per k inputs total pmos are k

77
00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.080
and pull down network is having nmos and

78
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.800
as per k

79
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.080
in mode nmos are

80
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.360
k so number of transistors

81
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.640
that is way greater in static cmos

82
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.720
compared to dynamic cmos that one can

83
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.599
say as well as

84
00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.599
here you see we avoid pmos fabrication

85
00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:24.640
in its structure

86
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.799
so here less number of pmos are there

87
00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.480
with dynamic cmos

88
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.360
so because of less number of pmos in

89
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.640
dynamic cmos

90
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.120
here total size as well as capacitive

91
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.879
loading will be less as well as you can

92
00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:37.920
find

93
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.400
switching characteristic is faster in

94
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.519
dynamic cmos

95
00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.440
so that is what the basic case which is

96
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.040
there with dynamic cmos now

97
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.720
i'll explain you dynamic cmos inverter

98
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.159
and then we will see how dynamic cmos

99
00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:55.280
functions

100
00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.959
so as we have seen the basic structure

101
00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.920
here in dynamic cmos inverter we have

102
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.439
vdd supply

103
00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.799
after that pmos gated clock

104
00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.799
that we need to have so here we provide

105
00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:09.840
clock

106
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.080
after that pull down network is there in

107
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.000
that there is only

108
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.918
1 and mos 4 inverator so here we give

109
00:04:17.918 --> 00:04:22.639
input after that we have

110
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.720
gated clock nmos over here

111
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.960
and then we connect this to ground and

112
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.520
we take output from this terminal

113
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.840
and here we have load capacitance

114
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.639
cl so this is a basic circuit which we

115
00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:39.840
have

116
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.960
for dynamic cmos inverter

117
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.560
now as if we talk about its working

118
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.160
then to understand it's working first

119
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.240
i'll explain you there are basically two

120
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.040
modes in which this circuit functions

121
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.000
first mode that is pre-charging mode

122
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.039
and second mode that is evaluation mode

123
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.120
i'll explain you how these two modes are

124
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.479
there for that

125
00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.479
we will see timing diagram

126
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.520
so in timing diagram here we will be

127
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.320
having

128
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.960
clock signal that we will observe with

129
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.800
respect to time

130
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.960
after that i will show you timing

131
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.479
diagram of input

132
00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.160
that is even we will evaluate with

133
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.800
respect to time

134
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.160
and then here we will observe our output

135
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.360
with respect to time and i will explain

136
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.320
you

137
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.320
how these two modes are associated

138
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.199
now see here in this clock we will be

139
00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:47.919
giving

140
00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.960
clock signal so clock signal will be

141
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.840
like this

142
00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:58.080
in that this is what logic zero of clock

143
00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.600
that one can say

144
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.160
this is logic one of clock this is logic

145
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.080
zero of clock and this is logic one of

146
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.960
clock

147
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.240
and here we give input that is logic

148
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.520
high

149
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.840
for this time period and logic low

150
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.199
for this time period right

151
00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:20.720
now i'll explain you how this circuit

152
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.759
functions

153
00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:23.840
in two different modes pre-charging mode

154
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.759
and evaluation mode

155
00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:28.800
now you see let us consider first case

156
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.919
where clock is equals to 0 and input is

157
00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:33.120
equals to 1

158
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.160
so now you see clock is equals to 0

159
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.160
and input is equals to 1 so this

160
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.360
pmos that will get on and this pmos that

161
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.639
will get off

162
00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:46.800
and this pmos that will get on but as

163
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.199
this pmos is off

164
00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:52.800
this load capacitance that will charge

165
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.680
via this pmos like this so this load

166
00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.560
capacitance

167
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.840
that will get charged by voltage vdd

168
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.000
right so here load capacitance that is

169
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.639
getting charged

170
00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:09.759
to voltage vdd and that is referred as

171
00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:11.360
pre-charging mode

172
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.479
right and you see here

173
00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:17.840
why pre-charging is happening so

174
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.919
see before we evaluate what is our

175
00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:20.880
output

176
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.240
first there will be pre-charging

177
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.440
that happens right and

178
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.280
here we don't evaluate what is our

179
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.639
output right

180
00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:32.560
the reason is even though if input is

181
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.759
zero

182
00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:36.720
this output that will get charged right

183
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.840
to vdd

184
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.479
so here first output voltage that will

185
00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:41.440
get charged

186
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.120
via pmos like this now you see

187
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.240
what will happen as if input is one and

188
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.360
clock is equals to one so when input is

189
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.479
one

190
00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:54.879
so at that time this nmos that will get

191
00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:56.639
on and this pmos

192
00:07:56.639 --> 00:08:00.000
that will get off and this nmos that

193
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.280
will get on

194
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.240
so whatever charge which is that in this

195
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.360
cl

196
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.479
that will get discharged via this loop

197
00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:11.599
and it will get grounded over here right

198
00:08:11.599 --> 00:08:13.919
so your output that will start to

199
00:08:13.919 --> 00:08:15.440
discharge

200
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.000
right and that discharging that is

201
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.840
depending on the resultant resistance

202
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.840
which is there with this circuit

203
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.960
and it will be having output which is

204
00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.240
logic 0 over here right so we can say

205
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.280
output is logic 0

206
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.599
and input is logic 1 so this is working

207
00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:36.080
as inverter

208
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.120
now you see in third case

209
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.599
our clock is equals to zero and input is

210
00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:43.039
equals to zero

211
00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.120
so when clock is equals to zero this

212
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.399
will get on

213
00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:48.560
and this will get off and input is

214
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.120
equals to zero so this will be even off

215
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.000
so again this load capacitance that will

216
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.880
get start

217
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.080
to charge via this pmos like this

218
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.279
right so you will be observing your

219
00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:03.200
load capacitance that will get start to

220
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.120
charge so output will

221
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.240
increase with respect to charging time

222
00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.080
constant which is associated with this

223
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.279
pmos

224
00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:15.360
and it will acquire vdd voltage

225
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.560
right and here you see again

226
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.279
what we do here we don't evaluate our

227
00:09:21.279 --> 00:09:22.160
output

228
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.560
right here we are just charging load

229
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.800
capacitance so here again three charging

230
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.399
is happening

231
00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:31.760
and now in fourth case

232
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.080
we have clock that is equals to one and

233
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.839
input is equals to 0

234
00:09:35.839 --> 00:09:37.920
so when clock is equals to 1 this will

235
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.440
get off

236
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.720
and this will get on and

237
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.640
input is equals to 0 so this will get

238
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.480
off so as this is off

239
00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.760
this load capacitance does not find

240
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.399
a path to get discharge so that will

241
00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:54.080
acquire

242
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.360
its voltage vdd only right during this

243
00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.480
state

244
00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.160
but here if you observe our output

245
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.160
is having that open circuit

246
00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.480
at input side over here so it will stay

247
00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.760
in high impedance mode

248
00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.399
so here you will be having output logic

249
00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:13.040
one

250
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.079
but output logic one

251
00:10:16.079 --> 00:10:19.279
that is there along with high

252
00:10:19.279 --> 00:10:23.040
impedance mode so output

253
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.160
is there

254
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:32.480
with high impedance

255
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.399
why output is there with high impedance

256
00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:36.480
the reason is this is there in open

257
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.519
circuit

258
00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:40.880
so this cl that does not find a part to

259
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.160
get discharge

260
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.560
right so it will be there in

261
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.680
high impedance mode and logic 1

262
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.800
so here you see what we do

263
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.079
here input is 0

264
00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.200
and output is 1 and here input is 1

265
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.959
output is zero so here we do

266
00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:03.680
evaluation

267
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.839
so basically pre-charging that happens

268
00:11:07.839 --> 00:11:11.440
when clock is equals to zero

269
00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:16.000
and evaluation that is done when

270
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.880
clock is equals to 1

271
00:11:21.839 --> 00:11:25.440
so that is how dynamic cmos is working

272
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.760
but here if you observe there are some

273
00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.839
issues which is there with this circuit

274
00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:32.079
see issue number one is when output is

275
00:11:32.079 --> 00:11:33.360
logic high

276
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.200
at a time it is there in high impedance

277
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.839
mode and high impedance mode

278
00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:41.440
is more prone to noise

279
00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.160
immunity right so noise immunity that

280
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.040
will be less

281
00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.720
in case of high impedance mode which is

282
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.320
there at output side

283
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.720
so this is one issue which is there with

284
00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.920
dynamic cmos

285
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.800
but if you observe as per the basic

286
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.320
discussion which we have done

287
00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.440
earlier total number of pmos

288
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.560
that is less compared to this static

289
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.639
cmos circuit here only one pmos

290
00:12:04.639 --> 00:12:07.200
is there right so that is one basic

291
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.959
advantage which is there with dynamic

292
00:12:08.959 --> 00:12:09.760
cmos

293
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.440
now what i'll do is i'll explain you

294
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.160
the basic advantages and disadvantages

295
00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.760
which is there with dynamic cmos

296
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.800
so when we talk about advantages then

297
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.600
you see

298
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.440
for one stage of dynamic cmos

299
00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.480
maximum output is vdd and minimum output

300
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.600
is ground

301
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.240
right so we can say voh that is vdd

302
00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.320
and vol that is 0 so it has

303
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:45.279
maximum voltage swing at output side

304
00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.680
now if you observe it's working then in

305
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.040
its working you find

306
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.639
that in on and off state at output side

307
00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:55.920
you will be finding

308
00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.600
there is no steady state current

309
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.839
so steady state current that is 0

310
00:13:03.839 --> 00:13:06.880
in output is equals to zero as well as

311
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.880
one

312
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.160
now if you observe in its structure

313
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.519
in that case you will be finding

314
00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:15.519
compared to static cmos

315
00:13:15.519 --> 00:13:18.800
number of pmos are very less it has only

316
00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.839
one pmos

317
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.279
and because of it has only one pmos its

318
00:13:25.279 --> 00:13:26.320
switching speed

319
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.760
is fast and

320
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.120
you will be finding as pmos is larger in

321
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.519
size and it has only one pmos

322
00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:38.079
so circuit size of dynamic cmos that

323
00:13:38.079 --> 00:13:38.880
will be

324
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.639
small so these are

325
00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:44.800
the advantages which is there with

326
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.360
dynamic cmos one more advantage that one

327
00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.240
can say

328
00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.519
it has less capacitance loading compared

329
00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:51.920
to

330
00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.800
static cmos

331
00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.480
now i'll discuss disadvantages which is

332
00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.199
there

333
00:13:59.199 --> 00:14:03.120
with dynamic cmos so when we talk about

334
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.320
disadvantages

335
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.440
then in its working i have explained

336
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.040
when you have output at logic 1

337
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.519
it is there in high impedance mode which

338
00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:14.959
is more

339
00:14:14.959 --> 00:14:18.959
affected by noise

340
00:14:20.959 --> 00:14:24.079
and if you observe it's working

341
00:14:24.079 --> 00:14:27.360
then here this dynamic cmos that cannot

342
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.000
work without having pre-charging so

343
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.279
pre-charging

344
00:14:31.279 --> 00:14:35.040
is compulsory to have a working

345
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.160
of dynamic cmos

346
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.399
now there are some more issues that i'll

347
00:14:40.399 --> 00:14:41.920
be going to discuss in

348
00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.040
my future videos dynamic cmos

349
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.480
is having a problem of cascading

350
00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.320
so that i'll explain you in my next

351
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.320
video it has a problem regarding

352
00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.959
cascading

353
00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:58.720
and dynamic cmos faces

354
00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.120
a problem of race so that even i'll

355
00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.199
explain you in my future videos

356
00:15:03.199 --> 00:15:07.120
so it has a race problem

357
00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.079
so these are the disadvantages and

358
00:15:10.079 --> 00:15:11.920
advantages which is there with dynamic

359
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:12.639
cmos

360
00:15:12.639 --> 00:15:14.720
i hope that you have understood this

361
00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.000
this cascading issue

362
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.079
and race problem that i'll be going to

363
00:15:18.079 --> 00:15:19.920
explain you in my next video so just
