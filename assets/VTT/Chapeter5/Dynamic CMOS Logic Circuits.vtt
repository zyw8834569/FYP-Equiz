[Music]

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.759
enemy cmos logic what happens is that

3
00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:10.160
there are two phases of operations

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.679
it happens with the clock signal

5
00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.000
whenever the clock is equal to zero

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
we call it as an a pre-charged state if

7
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.119
the clock equal to

8
00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.520
one we call it as an evaluate state

9
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.279
means until the next

10
00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.240
phase is uh occurred or until the next

11
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.000
stage has been uh

12
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.720
has arrived this particular logic is

13
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.439
going to be

14
00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.320
stored in that particular uh what is

15
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.079
that capacitor or the it is stored as in

16
00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.040
capacitance

17
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.280
next once the next stage is arrived then

18
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.120
that logic will be sent to the next

19
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.960
phase of the design so that is the

20
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.200
meaning of it is a temporary storage in

21
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.559
the

22
00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.320
temporary storage of the output levels

23
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.840
that will remain only for the short

24
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.039
period of time

25
00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:50.879
the static logic retains its output

26
00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.360
levels as long as the power is applied

27
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.280
in the static it is not the same in the

28
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.120
static what happens until the power is

29
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.960
supplied the output will be remained

30
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.719
there but in the dynamic what happens

31
00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.399
depending upon the switching of the

32
00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.239
clock which is connected as an input to

33
00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.680
the transistors

34
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.360
the output will be stored there for

35
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.200
until the next clock arrives

36
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.200
so that is the meaning of uh it's a

37
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.799
temporary storage

38
00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.840
logic so now here in the dynamic logic

39
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.680
is normally done with the charging and

40
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.080
selectively discharging the capacitor

41
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.119
capacitances that is uh where are those

42
00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.080
capacitors

43
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.240
circuit nodes now here if you want any

44
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.240
of the operation to be

45
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.640
uh any any one part of that model to be

46
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.400
operated very fastly there you

47
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.720
will try to discharge that particular

48
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.159
capacitor so that

49
00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:37.759
the discharging means that output has

50
00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.320
been obtained then so that it it gives a

51
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.280
path for the next

52
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.960
stage of the design to obtain its

53
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.520
output so how the output is obtained

54
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.600
only when the capacitor is fully charged

55
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.200
so if a capacitor is fully charged we

56
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.960
say that output is obtained

57
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.200
and if the capacitor is fully discharged

58
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.399
we say it is

59
00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.960
giving a path for the next phase of the

60
00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.759
design to

61
00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.840
obtain its output so that's the meaning

62
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.680
of selectively discharging the capacitor

63
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.680
whether you need required

64
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.439
the speed of the particular signal or

65
00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.878
wherever you need the performance of the

66
00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:09.840
signal to be

67
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.480
enhanced so let us see now see now it is

68
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.000
a pre-charge phase and the

69
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.640
evaluates phase in the pre-charge clock

70
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.280
it is a

71
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.760
the clock to charge the capacitance that

72
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.520
is a clock equal to clock signal equal

73
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.000
to zero

74
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.400
is a pre-charge state evaluate state is

75
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.239
a clock which is used to discharge the

76
00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.440
capacitance depending upon the

77
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.720
conditions of the

78
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.280
logical inputs so now we will study

79
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.720
about this one in the coming slides what

80
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.560
is pre-charge and what is discharge

81
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.800
uh and what is evaluate with respect to

82
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.000
some examples

83
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.400
so let us see now advantages of this

84
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.720
dynamic cmos logic over the static

85
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.120
it avoids the duplicating of the logic

86
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.920
logic

87
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.040
twice as a both entry and the p3

88
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.920
has in this uh standard cmos logic so

89
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.360
here you will not be having any kind of

90
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.800
a duplicating uh

91
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.720
uh duplicating of the what is that uh

92
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.959
entries or the p3s peters or entrance of

93
00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.080
nothing else but

94
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.319
network so nmos network and the pmos

95
00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.840
networks you'll not be having a

96
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.599
duplication because in the static we

97
00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:08.480
have seen that

98
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.640
it requires some n number of gates if

99
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.000
there are n inputs are there then it

100
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.760
requires two n types of uh

101
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.760
devices but that kind of duplication is

102
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.959
not uh

103
00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.920
taken place here typically it can be

104
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.360
used in very high performance

105
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.319
applications

106
00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.159
the dynamic cmos logic is used in the

107
00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.080
very high performance application next

108
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.560
one

109
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.040
it is used in the sequential memory

110
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.840
circuits

111
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.959
and also it is used and amenable to the

112
00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.239
synchronous logics

113
00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.000
it is used mostly in the synchronous

114
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.599
logics and also in the sequential memory

115
00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:38.400
circuits

116
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.799
next one is a very high density

117
00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:41.519
achievable

118
00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.200
high density achievable means you can

119
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.120
fit large number of devices in the

120
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.480
networks in the trees

121
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.040
in the nmos or pmos trees you can fit

122
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.400
more number of transistors

123
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.200
so it's a it's a denser logic and it

124
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.040
also consumes a lesser power in some

125
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.000
cases

126
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.439
now coming to the disadvantage we'll

127
00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:59.280
talk about some cases

128
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.840
in the next slides uh coming to

129
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.959
disadvantages

130
00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.920
compared to the static logic the problem

131
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:06.720
with the

132
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.959
clock synchronization and timing so now

133
00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.640
here what happens is that

134
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.959
since we are having two different clocks

135
00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.640
the clocks has to arrive at the same

136
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.120
time

137
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.199
if the clocks are arriving at the same

138
00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:18.880
time then only we can say that

139
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.639
the inputs which have been given to the

140
00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:21.918
particular tree

141
00:04:21.918 --> 00:04:24.320
or particular network will be arriving

142
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.160
or will be moving at the same

143
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.560
time phase but if one clock is arriving

144
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.759
at one particular

145
00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:32.000
time and other clock is arriving uh with

146
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.520
a delay then what happens

147
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.280
the first signal will be going faster

148
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.800
but whereas the second signal

149
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.040
it will be delayed so that's a major

150
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.840
problem we'll see when that one in the

151
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.320
graphs of the

152
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.240
dynamic cmos strategy another one the

153
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.840
designs is more complex

154
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.919
more difficult why because more number

155
00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.600
of trees

156
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.199
in the more number of transistors have

157
00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.280
been connected and it's also a dense

158
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.520
uh dense network

159
00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.600
so now this is a small uh explanation

160
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.440
about how the cmos

161
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.759
dynamics cmos looks like it's like it's

162
00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:05.280
a two-step operation

163
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.800
the pre-charge state will be there and

164
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.720
evaluate state will be there why do we

165
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.320
use a pre-charge state the pre-charge

166
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.600
state is mainly used

167
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.560
in order to charge the uh signal and uh

168
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.680
that is a

169
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.919
to the high uh to the logic high and the

170
00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.360
evaluate state is mainly used to

171
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.400
discharge this

172
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.560
clock signal cs means it's a clock

173
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.680
signal a

174
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.280
clock signal this is the phi which you

175
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.199
see this is a clock signal here also you

176
00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:28.479
can see the clock signal

177
00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.240
so now whenever the clock is equal to

178
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.880
zero if a clock equal to zero the pmos

179
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.759
is turned on

180
00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:35.199
whenever the pmos is turned on what

181
00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:37.039
happens the output is fully charged why

182
00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:37.600
because

183
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.000
the vdd will flow to the clock and it

184
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.880
will be stored

185
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.120
the car it is stored as a charge in this

186
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.000
capacitor

187
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.520
that's why the capacitance will be

188
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.759
formed here and but whenever it is clock

189
00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:48.240
is

190
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.560
evaluate evaluate means what clock equal

191
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.639
to one if clock equal to one what is

192
00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:54.479
what happens the pmos is off

193
00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.520
and n mos will be turned on if n was

194
00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.080
turned on then the complete whatever the

195
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.360
charge is stored

196
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.919
that will be discharged depending upon

197
00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:05.039
this transistors

198
00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:07.600
inputs let me say now if this this

199
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.199
transfer is turned on

200
00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:11.039
then this complete what are the

201
00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:13.199
capacitor capacitance is stored in the

202
00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:13.919
previous state

203
00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:17.039
of recharge it will be discharged from

204
00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:19.680
this capacitor to the ground terminal so

205
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.600
that is a that's the meaning of

206
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.759
how the evaluate and pre-charge will be

207
00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:25.120
working you can see you know

208
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.880
this is a pre-charge state in the

209
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.160
pre-charge state what happens the

210
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.120
capacitance is

211
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.160
you can see the high high high value so

212
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.000
if it is equal to 0 the value will be

213
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.560
high

214
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.280
whenever this is a one uh even that

215
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.039
that's the evaluate state again it's a

216
00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:40.080
pre-charge state

217
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.840
so this is this one is regarding the

218
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.520
clock uh these are inputs

219
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.800
and these are the two pre-charge and

220
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.639
evaluate state functions

221
00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:49.039
and this is a small explanation about

222
00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:50.479
what is meant by dynamic in order to

223
00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:52.000
give an idea about this one

224
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.680
now let us study in detail about what is

225
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.800
dynamic cmos logic

226
00:06:57.039 --> 00:06:59.680
in the dynamic cmos logic the circuit

227
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.160
relies on a complementary storage of

228
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.160
the signal values on the capacitance of

229
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.520
high impedance node

230
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.240
this one here is a it will rely on the

231
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.960
com

232
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.440
temporary storage logic why because the

233
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.840
signal is stored here temporarily

234
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.400
for the phase of this clock if the clock

235
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.680
is equal to zero

236
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.840
then the store the capacitor will be

237
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.440
stored or the it will be

238
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.880
filled with the capacitance or that it

239
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.400
will be filled with the capacitor or the

240
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.000
capacitor is fully charged

241
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
whenever the clock equal to one this

242
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.080
pmos is turned off and the nmos is

243
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.520
turned on that's why the discharging

244
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.319
takes place

245
00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:35.520
so it says temporary storage uh logic

246
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.800
here and it requires yeah n plus two uh

247
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.360
n plus two uh devices this particular

248
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.880
dynamic cmos logic requires

249
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.759
n plus 2 what is this meant by n plus 2

250
00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:46.800
since here

251
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.960
this block is a pull-up pull-down

252
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.919
network

253
00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:51.360
pull down if there are n number of

254
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.960
pull-down network then the

255
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.520
n transistors will be n plus 1 it will

256
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.720
be n plus 1

257
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.840
plus one the pmos so it will be like

258
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.479
n plus two uh devices required whereas

259
00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:02.960
if i

260
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.720
consider for the cmos structure or

261
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.240
static sigma structure

262
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.639
for the same operation uh for the same

263
00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:10.400
operation what is this operation

264
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.759
it is like both the nmos are in series

265
00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:15.280
both inverse are in series

266
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.840
if nmos are in series means citizen b

267
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.479
dot c

268
00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:21.280
b dot c plus a it means it is like the

269
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.199
operation for this one is

270
00:08:23.199 --> 00:08:26.720
y equal to for this network the

271
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.360
operation is

272
00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:34.479
y equal to a plus a plus b dot

273
00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:41.839
c y equal to

274
00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:43.440
this is operation this is a boolean

275
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.200
equation for this network it is a plus

276
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.200
a plus bc that is b dot c so now if

277
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.560
you can see what will be the uh value of

278
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.200
this one

279
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.240
a plus b b dot c means what you require

280
00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.680
there are three different uh

281
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.839
inputs here three different inputs means

282
00:09:01.839 --> 00:09:04.000
you you need a three p mos and three n

283
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:04.560
mods

284
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.240
though ultimately what will be there

285
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.839
three p mos three and m

286
00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:10.720
you you it's like now we need six

287
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.640
different transistors here

288
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.480
six different transistors but here you

289
00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.000
can see there are only

290
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.360
uh five transfers so number of

291
00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.800
transistors have been decreased for this

292
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.080
one for this particular

293
00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.160
uh device or for this particular

294
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.640
operation

295
00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.760
and this is a

296
00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:34.080
block diagram of dynamics cmos logic

297
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.839
first you'll be having a pmos two the

298
00:09:35.839 --> 00:09:37.839
clock will be connected and here down it

299
00:09:37.839 --> 00:09:39.760
is a footer uh for this nmos is

300
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.640
connected

301
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.320
and now in between there will be

302
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.240
pull-down network this is a pull-down

303
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.839
network which defines your boolean

304
00:09:45.839 --> 00:09:46.800
equation

305
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.080
and this uh this complete this emp and

306
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.519
me

307
00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:53.600
are compulsory this is a pre-charged

308
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.560
mosfet and this

309
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.560
evaluates mosfet mp means pre-charge

310
00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.080
mosfet me means

311
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.640
evaluate mosfet clock this is a clock

312
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.399
signal whichever you supply here

313
00:10:02.399 --> 00:10:04.399
and this one did not denotes your

314
00:10:04.399 --> 00:10:06.240
boolean equation

315
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.839
and this is the same one which we have

316
00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:09.920
taken it is a uh

317
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.079
now here the inputs are changed here so

318
00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:13.519
i can write it as a dot b

319
00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:15.839
plus c the boolean equation here it is

320
00:10:15.839 --> 00:10:17.360
since both the inverse are in

321
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.560
series the operation will be a dot b for

322
00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.680
n was and it is this two are in parallel

323
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.360
to the c so it will be plus

324
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.200
a dot b plus c y equal to a dot b plus c

325
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.800
is a boolean equation and this is a

326
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.399
circuit diagram for

327
00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:35.200
boolean equation y equal to a dot b plus

328
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:35.760
c

329
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.760
using the dynamic cmos logic structure

330
00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:42.079
so now let us study in detail about this

331
00:10:42.079 --> 00:10:43.519
one uh

332
00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:45.440
can anyone tell me what is a boolean

333
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.800
equation of this circuit

334
00:10:55.839 --> 00:10:58.839
what is the boolean equation of this

335
00:10:58.839 --> 00:11:01.839
circuit

336
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.440
all three nmos are in series and again

337
00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.440
those three nmos are parallel to the two

338
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.560
nmos which are in again in series if

339
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.399
that is the case your boolean equation

340
00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:13.680
will become as

341
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:18.399
a1 dot a2 dot a3

342
00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.399
plus b1 dot b2 so that becomes your

343
00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:23.920
boolean equation for this one

344
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.079
why because all the n was nmos will be

345
00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:28.240
in series only for a

346
00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.120
dot operation so now you since this dot

347
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:31.680
operation

348
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.720
a1 dot a2 dot a3 dot

349
00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.360
this will be taken in bracket plus this

350
00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.880
both are in again in a

351
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.560
series so it is b1 dot b2 and this b1 b2

352
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.880
is in parallel to the a1 a2 a3 so i

353
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.480
taken the plus in between

354
00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.839
so it is a1 a2 a3 plus b1 b2 so that is

355
00:11:49.839 --> 00:11:51.600
your boolean equation and that for the

356
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.880
boolean equation

357
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.360
this is your uh dynamics imos logic

358
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.560
structure

359
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.000
so let us see the operation of this

360
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
circuit in the dynamic cmos logic

361
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.880
structure

362
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.880
here a single clock phase has been used

363
00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.079
five phi

364
00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:07.200
and that happens upon the evaluate and

365
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.360
reach our state evaluate means what log

366
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.639
clock equal to one

367
00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:13.040
recharge means what clock equal to uh

368
00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.040
zero so now i have taken clock equal to

369
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.519
five

370
00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:17.519
whenever the clock equal to zero that is

371
00:12:17.519 --> 00:12:18.880
a low low state

372
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.880
now what happens only the pmos is turned

373
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.560
on pmos is turned on and

374
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.519
footer invoices turned off now in this

375
00:12:25.519 --> 00:12:26.880
case what happens

376
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.680
the vdd will be uh will be dragged to

377
00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.440
the output so that the capacitor here

378
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.800
whichever the capacitor is connected

379
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.920
output will be

380
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.600
fully charged so that's why you can see

381
00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.839
you know the pmos pre-charges the

382
00:12:37.839 --> 00:12:38.480
transistor

383
00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.240
mp charges output to vdd so now this v

384
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.839
out will become equal to vdd

385
00:12:43.839 --> 00:12:45.680
approximately will become vdd

386
00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.600
so therefore it will remain in the

387
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.360
linear region during the final

388
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.480
pre-charge state

389
00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.279
so because whenever it is a zero

390
00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:54.959
whenever the clock equal to zero

391
00:12:54.959 --> 00:12:57.040
your output is going to be one the

392
00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.480
output is going to be one

393
00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.519
now during this time the logic input a

394
00:13:01.519 --> 00:13:04.639
a one two b b two are active

395
00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:07.760
r active means what uh here all the

396
00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.800
transistors are

397
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.519
uh working uh depending upon the values

398
00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:12.800
which are given to here

399
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.959
given to these two gates a1 a2 a3 b1 b2

400
00:13:16.959 --> 00:13:20.480
so now whenever this one and you can

401
00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.519
even see in this one

402
00:13:21.519 --> 00:13:23.600
since the clock equal to zero the this

403
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.279
one m a will become off

404
00:13:25.279 --> 00:13:27.120
therefore no charge will be lost from

405
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.440
the v out no charges lost from the v

406
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.399
auto means since this are active if all

407
00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:32.800
these

408
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.360
nmos are on then only the vdd will

409
00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.079
discharge

410
00:13:36.079 --> 00:13:37.839
then all the vr will discharge to this

411
00:13:37.839 --> 00:13:40.000
particular point but since they are not

412
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:40.399
on

413
00:13:40.399 --> 00:13:42.320
only if you are on if you are off they

414
00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.920
are acting in some other case some of

415
00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:44.959
the case

416
00:13:44.959 --> 00:13:47.440
the output will not be lost so whenever

417
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.199
the clock equal to high what happens if

418
00:13:49.199 --> 00:13:50.560
clock equal to high

419
00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.120
because of that one the pmos is turned

420
00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.959
off nmos is turned on

421
00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:57.600
inverse is turned on if nmos is turned

422
00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.800
on what happens

423
00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.120
allowing for output to be selectively

424
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.040
discharged selectively discharge means

425
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:03.680
what

426
00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.560
the output if b1 and b2 are turned on

427
00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.120
since we

428
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.440
both are nmos whenever i supply logic

429
00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.800
one to this both the inputs

430
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.480
if these are turned on then only the

431
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.639
output can move from this part

432
00:14:14.639 --> 00:14:17.120
from this path to the ground that is the

433
00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.880
meaning of selectively discharging

434
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.199
or else if if this three are turned on

435
00:14:21.199 --> 00:14:22.639
then the output can move from the

436
00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:25.199
capacitor through this a1 a2 and a3

437
00:14:25.199 --> 00:14:26.720
so this is a meaning of what is meant by

438
00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.160
selectively discharging

439
00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.760
can you tell what is the first point

440
00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.760
first point is like whenever the

441
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.480
five uh clock is equal to zero if clock

442
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.519
equal to zero

443
00:14:37.519 --> 00:14:39.839
uh the gate voltage which is supply here

444
00:14:39.839 --> 00:14:40.560
here is

445
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.040
zero and this is one of the query which

446
00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.000
has been asked to me right

447
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.399
now so now if clock equal to zero the

448
00:14:46.399 --> 00:14:47.600
pmos is turned

449
00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.519
on the pmos will be turned on whenever

450
00:14:49.519 --> 00:14:51.120
the gate voltage is equal to zero

451
00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.560
nmos will be turned off whenever the

452
00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.480
gate voltage is equal to zero it means

453
00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.120
that

454
00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.519
at gate voltage equal to zero the pmos

455
00:14:57.519 --> 00:14:59.120
will be turned on and nmos will be

456
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.079
turned off

457
00:15:00.079 --> 00:15:01.839
so now in the clock one whenever the

458
00:15:01.839 --> 00:15:03.839
clock equal to zero the pmos is turned

459
00:15:03.839 --> 00:15:04.320
on

460
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.399
a channel has been created through that

461
00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:08.800
particular channel the vtd will be

462
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.120
now moves from vdd to the output why

463
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.000
because the potential

464
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.079
difference has been created but due to

465
00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:15.440
that potential difference

466
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.440
uh in order to have an equilibrium in

467
00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.839
the potential the vdd moves from

468
00:15:19.839 --> 00:15:22.320
the logic one will move from this point

469
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:22.880
to the

470
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.639
capacitor which is stored which is

471
00:15:24.639 --> 00:15:26.079
connected to the output

472
00:15:26.079 --> 00:15:27.920
in that case the capacitor will be fully

473
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.839
charged that's the meaning of this one

474
00:15:29.839 --> 00:15:33.360
the output mp charges the output to vdd

475
00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.279
means the logic one will be obtained at

476
00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:36.720
the capacitor which is connected to the

477
00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.440
output

478
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.839
so next one whenever the phi is equal to

479
00:15:39.839 --> 00:15:42.480
high the mp is turned off and the nmos

480
00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:46.240
evaluate will be turned on

481
00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.160
if this is turned on depending upon this

482
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.399
transistor depending upon the onstage of

483
00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:51.360
this transistor

484
00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.120
the output will be discharged through

485
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.560
the ground that is the meaning of

486
00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.160
selective discharging

487
00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.839
the selective discharging will be taken

488
00:15:57.839 --> 00:15:59.680
place allowing for the output to be

489
00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.519
selectively discharged to the ground

490
00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:02.959
depending upon the logical

491
00:16:02.959 --> 00:16:05.920
inputs logical inputs means this a1 a2

492
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:06.800
a3 gate

493
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.000
inputs if in a1 to a b2

494
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.959
inputs are are such that conductive path

495
00:16:12.959 --> 00:16:14.000
existing between v

496
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.959
out and me then the b out is discharged

497
00:16:16.959 --> 00:16:17.839
to zero

498
00:16:17.839 --> 00:16:21.360
if all these transistors are turned on

499
00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:25.199
if all this transfer a1 a2 a3 b1 b2 b3

500
00:16:25.199 --> 00:16:26.079
and b2

501
00:16:26.079 --> 00:16:27.839
all are turned on means what i have

502
00:16:27.839 --> 00:16:30.000
given a logic one to all the gates of

503
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.759
this transistor if it is turned on

504
00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:34.000
then whatever the complete uh there is a

505
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.839
complete path has been created between

506
00:16:35.839 --> 00:16:36.240
the v

507
00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.800
out and uh ground so the complete

508
00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.839
discharging of the

509
00:16:39.839 --> 00:16:41.360
signal takes place from the output to

510
00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.880
ground that's the meaning of this one

511
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.120
the output will be discharged to zero

512
00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.320
otherwise the v out remains to

513
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.560
bdd if this is not turned on let me

514
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.680
assume that

515
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.680
this a2 a3 and b2 are turned on

516
00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.920
but a a1 and b b1 are not turned on

517
00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.240
then what happens there is no other way

518
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.000
for the output to discharge to

519
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.319
ground so the output will be vdd only

520
00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:07.839
why because there is no channel

521
00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:10.720
created for this a1 and b1 the output

522
00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:11.280
cannot

523
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.799
discharge to the ground so that's the

524
00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:14.400
meaning of otherwise the v out

525
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.679
it will remain at vdd

526
00:17:17.679 --> 00:17:19.839
this is another network another network

527
00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:21.520
you can see the operation here

528
00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.839
uh pre-charged and evaluated recharge

529
00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:25.199
means logic uh

530
00:17:25.199 --> 00:17:27.119
clock equal to zero evaluate means clock

531
00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:33.840
equal to one

532
00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:45.440
uh okay now here we will

533
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.640
complete this particular part and we'll

534
00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.360
wind up

535
00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:53.200
or else i think it's time

536
00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.440
up as of now why because i have come up

537
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.200
with more uh

538
00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.880
yeah time is up because i have come up

539
00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.640
with nearly 60 slides today

540
00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.080
in order to deal these topics 60 to 65

541
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.960
but it's a very huge concept uh i hope

542
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.320
you understood now uh

543
00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.880
up to now

544
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.120
yes yeah the dynamic cmos logic means

545
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.880
always keep in your mind it will be

546
00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.480
having one pmos as

547
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:22.320
a pull-up network and sorry as a pull-up

548
00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.200
device and a

549
00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.799
n-mos has a pull-down device which is

550
00:18:24.799 --> 00:18:26.799
taken as a footer in between you will be

551
00:18:26.799 --> 00:18:28.000
having your boolean equation

552
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.160
network see this is a boolean equation

553
00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.440
network this is a

554
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.000
pre-charge transistor and this is a uh

555
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.919
what is that evaluate transistor

556
00:18:35.919 --> 00:18:38.160
but in between all this other boolean

557
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.600
equation what is the boolean equation a

558
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.720
dot b plus c

559
00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.760
plus b dot e whole bar

560
00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.200
so like that you should try to

561
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.679
understand the network in tomorrow's

562
00:18:47.679 --> 00:18:51.200
class we'll try to complete as much as

563
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.080
we can

564
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.960
and we'll see that operations okay thank

565
00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.480
you everyone thank you for

566
00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.679
listening this particular class

567
00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.799
excuse me sir yeah please tell me sir

568
00:19:04.799 --> 00:19:06.480
something there is a doubt with

569
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.600
four to well i'm unmuting

570
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.000
could you please tell again i'm unable

571
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:12.720
to hear you

572
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.880
something there is a doubt with food

573
00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.160
where it seems

574
00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.559
something there is doubt there is a

575
00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:19.760
doubt for

576
00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:24.240
me yes

577
00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.919
yeah is this one i said yeah please tell

578
00:19:31.919 --> 00:19:32.720
me

579
00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.400
sir here when clock is high end

580
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.960
inverse will

581
00:19:50.799 --> 00:19:52.640
whenever the clock is zero what has

582
00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.320
happened let me assume that first stage

583
00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.840
is my clock equal to zero

584
00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.760
then what happens this will be turned

585
00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.600
off this nmos is turned off and this

586
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.720
will be turned on

587
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.640
in this state only the vtd will be

588
00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.919
pre-charged means what

589
00:20:03.919 --> 00:20:06.559
your capacitance is now fully charged

590
00:20:06.559 --> 00:20:08.240
with the value of vdd

591
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.880
okay is it okay that is the previous

592
00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.360
state

593
00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.360
now let us come to your point your point

594
00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.760
is what whenever clock equal to high

595
00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.440
whenever clock equal to high whatever

596
00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.360
you told is correct the pmos is turned

597
00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.720
off and nmos is turned on is it okay

598
00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.640
now you're talking about this one right

599
00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.919
v out remains vdd

600
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.440
could you please talk to me

601
00:20:33.679 --> 00:20:35.919
could you please talk to me anyone yes

602
00:20:35.919 --> 00:20:38.080
sir

603
00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.559
this is your point how it is we be out

604
00:20:40.559 --> 00:20:42.159
will remain videos

605
00:20:42.159 --> 00:20:43.919
yeah how the way out is remain weeded it

606
00:20:43.919 --> 00:20:45.200
means what has happened in the previous

607
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:45.600
state

608
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.080
your capacitor is fully charged right

609
00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.000
forget about now in this state the pmos

610
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:50.720
is off

611
00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.039
whenever the capacitor is fully charged

612
00:20:53.039 --> 00:20:54.080
see this point

613
00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.360
if a1 to b2 if a1 to b2 means all this

614
00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.200
transistor phi transistor

615
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.880
which is an a1 a2 a3 plus b1 b2

616
00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.159
operation

617
00:21:04.159 --> 00:21:06.880
are such that conducting the path exists

618
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:07.679
if all

619
00:21:07.679 --> 00:21:10.320
if all are on if all are on means what

620
00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.480
for all this value the gate voltage is

621
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.520
given as zeros

622
00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.640
sorry for all these gates the input is

623
00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.720
given as logic one logic one logic one

624
00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.080
logic one logic one

625
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.760
whenever the gate is given a gate input

626
00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.120
has given us logic one

627
00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.880
all those transfers will be turned on

628
00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.120
then we did a v odd will become zero

629
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.240
why because the previous state uh

630
00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.799
will be moving to the ground but

631
00:21:32.799 --> 00:21:33.679
otherwise

632
00:21:33.679 --> 00:21:36.559
otherwise otherwise means what if these

633
00:21:36.559 --> 00:21:38.640
transistors are not turned on

634
00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.520
that's why i have given example if a2 a3

635
00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:41.840
and

636
00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:45.679
b2 are turned on but a1 and 8

637
00:21:45.679 --> 00:21:47.840
b1 are turned off turned off means there

638
00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:48.960
is no path

639
00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.520
for from this point from this drain of

640
00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.400
this a1

641
00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.880
and from the drain of b1 to reach to the

642
00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.840
drain off

643
00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:14.400
i hope you can understand telugu right

644
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.120
because of that reason the vdd cannot

645
00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.720
discharge to the ground because this

646
00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.679
both are off

647
00:22:19.679 --> 00:22:23.600
otherwise the vr remains vdd i hope my

648
00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.799
your point is clear now sir if all our

649
00:22:26.799 --> 00:22:27.840
affirmative

650
00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.600
also output output is vdd

651
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.559
focus if all our off means there is no

652
00:22:34.559 --> 00:22:36.559
point for the vdd to the capacitor to

653
00:22:36.559 --> 00:22:38.480
discharge to the ground

654
00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.080
why does the discharging takes place

655
00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.640
because of the potential difference

656
00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.240
potential difference while a name yes

657
00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.720
that discharging will takes place

658
00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.919
and when all are on uh the capacitor

659
00:22:49.919 --> 00:22:51.200
will discharge

660
00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.840
yeah when all are on the capacitor will

661
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.919
discharge or else or else if these two

662
00:22:55.919 --> 00:22:56.960
are on also

663
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.960
if all these are off and these two are

664
00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.799
off also there is a path created

665
00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:03.919
from this point to the ground even in

666
00:23:03.919 --> 00:23:05.520
that case also the capacitance will

667
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.400
discharge capacitor will discharge

668
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.520
okay okay okay

669
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.440
okay thank you thank you and tomorrow's

670
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.360
class we'll study in more detail about

671
00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.200
few more operations and we'll go to the

672
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.480
domino logic

673
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.840
okay thank you i'm i'm leaving this

674
00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.840
session
