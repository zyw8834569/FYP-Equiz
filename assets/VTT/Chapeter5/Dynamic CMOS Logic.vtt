00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:02.639
hello everyone welcome to this video

2
00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:03.520
lecture

3
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.720
on dynamic cmos logic

4
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.679
here the circuit is showing the dynamic

5
00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:10.400
cmos

6
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.920
general structure the dynamic cmas

7
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.039
will be having a clock signal as input

8
00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.840
to the pre-charge p mass transistor and

9
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.960
to the gate of

10
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.560
evaluate transistor of n mass

11
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.960
so the logical circuit we are going to

12
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.000
write by using n

13
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.039
transistors network it will be acting as

14
00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.079
a pull down network and

15
00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.000
we will be having a single pmos

16
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.200
transistor

17
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.280
and we are calling it as a pre-charge

18
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.559
transistor

19
00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.280
and one more n transistor under n

20
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.039
transistor network

21
00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.079
to evaluate the logic now we will see

22
00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.399
how

23
00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.960
actually this circuit is going to behave

24
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.640
when we are going to provide

25
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.480
the clock signal here you can observe

26
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.640
the timing diagram when clock is 0

27
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.760
the output is vdd means

28
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.720
output is logic 1 when clock is equal to

29
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.600
1

30
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.640
it is evaluate state and output will be

31
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.880
evaluated as per the logic

32
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.320
if if there is any path from the output

33
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.280
reaches ground if any of the input is

34
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.680
high

35
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.040
so that output will be zero

36
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.360
if any path reaches to the ground in the

37
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.040
pull down network

38
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.680
it will be the output will be reaches to

39
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.400
zero

40
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.320
there will be a chance of getting zero

41
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.880
output only in the evaluate state

42
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.720
in the pre-charge state output will be

43
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.520
one that's why the output is pre-charged

44
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.159
to 1

45
00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.600
when clock is equal to 0 we can say

46
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.560
how that output is going to be 1 in

47
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.680
pre-charge

48
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.880
state because of clock is equal to 0

49
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.000
this pmos transistor is turning on

50
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.960
and this evaluate transistor is turning

51
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.000
off

52
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.600
even if we are going to provide the

53
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.000
different kind of inputs over here

54
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.960
there is no direct path from output to

55
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.600
ground

56
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.080
because of this evaluate transistor is

57
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.360
in off state

58
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.120
there will be an open circuit between

59
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.520
the ground terminal and the output

60
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.080
and this pre-charged pmos transistor is

61
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.520
on

62
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.840
it will make the contact to vdd terminal

63
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.160
and the output terminal so that the

64
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.239
output capacitor is going to

65
00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.160
charge this is how the dynamic cmos

66
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.239
logic is going to work

67
00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.040
so in place of n transistor network that

68
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.640
is the pull down network

69
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.879
if you put the transistor connections as

70
00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.160
per our logic

71
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.040
this dynamic cmas logic is going to work

72
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.760
as per

73
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.319
the logic what we are going to write

74
00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.200
thank you
