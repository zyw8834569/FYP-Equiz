00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.800
Hello and welcome to today’s lecture, on
MOS dynamic circuits. It is the first lecture

2
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:31.689
on this topic, and in two lectures, I shall
consider different aspects of dynamic circuits

3
00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:39.280
that are the MOS dynamic circuits. And here
is the agenda of today’s lecture, after

4
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:46.809
a brief introduction about what we have discussed
in my earlier lectures. I shall discuss about

5
00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:54.809
single-phase nMOS dynamic circuits although
these are not in wide use, but for the sake

6
00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.660
of completeness, we have to discuss it. Then
we shall see discuss about two-phase two-phase

7
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:10.200
MOS nMOS dynamic circuits, and also we shall
discuss about two-phase clock generation technique

8
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.909
followed by two-phase CMOS dynamic circuits.
Then finally, I shall conclude our lecture

9
00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.479
by discussing the advantages and limitation
of dynamic circuits.

10
00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:29.210
Coming to the introduction, we have seen that
pseudo-nMOS static circuits have two disadvantages.

11
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.000
So, they draw static current as long as power
remains on and, because of ratioed logic,

12
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.129
low-level output is not strong. On the other
hand, there is no static power dissipation

13
00:01:42.129 --> 00:01:46.700
in CMOS circuits, but logic function is implemented
twice.

14
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:58.340
Let me consider a very simple function say
you have to realize y is equal to x 1 plus

15
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:14.110
x 2 x 3. So, using static CMOS, what will
you do? You will realize this function you

16
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:21.750
have to take compliment of this; that means,
this will be the compliment of this is x bar

17
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:35.120
dot x 2 bar x 3 bar. So, this is your y bar.
So, the network will correspond to this this

18
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:46.799
x bar x 1 bar dot x 2 bar plus x 3 bar. So,
the circuit will be like this. So, it will

19
00:02:46.799 --> 00:03:06.560
have x 1 x 1 dash and then x 2 dash x 3 dash
and these are connected to ground, and the

20
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.640
pMOS network will be dual of that; that means,
here you will have these are parallel. So,

21
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:32.310
they will be in series. So, x 1 dash and x
2 dash x 3 dash. And you will take the output

22
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:43.819
from here, but if you realize the is the static
CMOS and if you realize by using pseudo-nMOS

23
00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:53.799
then you do not require. So, many pMOS transistors
you require only one pMOS transistor and then

24
00:03:53.799 --> 00:04:09.999
the n MOS network part is identical x 1 dash
and you will have x 2 dash x 3 dash.

25
00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:16.089
So, we if let us compare the advantages and
disadvantages which we have discussed in detail

26
00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:22.210
in the last two lectures. So, static CMOS
circuits as we can see same functionality

27
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:36.360
is implemented twice in the pMOS network and
the nMOS network. So, it requires large area

28
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:47.259
and here you can say smaller area and, because
of large area and next stage we will drive

29
00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:57.270
both to a p MOS transistor and n MOS transistor,
because of that the capacitance is large.

30
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:07.210
So, delay is long longer delay long delay
primary primarily, because of larger area

31
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:14.129
and you have to drive two transistors simultaneously
and also; however, the main advantage of this

32
00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:25.650
is the power dissipation is there is no static
power dissipation. So, no static power dissipation.

33
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:32.960
On the other hand is in case of pseudo small
nMOS circuit it has occupies smaller area

34
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:45.120
smaller small delay smaller delay, but there
is static power dissipation static power dissipation

35
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:56.520
is there. And it has been found that the pseudo-nMOS
circuits can be 5 times faster than that of

36
00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:05.199
static CMOS circuits. So, as I mention in
my last lecture, we have to combine the advantages

37
00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:11.800
of both pseudo-nMOS and static CMOS and we
have seen, because of extra area and extra

38
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.740
number of transistors the load capacitance
of on gates of static CMOS circuits is considerably

39
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.130
higher.
So, speeds of operation of static CMOS and

40
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:29.780
pseudo-nMOS circuits are not fairly comparable
as I mention that pseudo-n MOS circuits are

41
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:37.669
faster, because the of course, the static
CMOS has twice the available current drive,

42
00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:46.129
but static CMOS has got twice the capacitance
of nMOS. So, although current drive is larger

43
00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:53.990
and, but because of larger capacitance delay
is longer. So, whenever you have choice between

44
00:06:53.990 --> 00:07:00.680
pseudo-nMOS and static CMOS on what basis
you will select one from the other if low

45
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:13.629
power is of importance than you will go for
your static CMOS. On the other hand higher

46
00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:23.599
speed is of requirement then you will go for
pseudo-nMOS. Now what we are interested in

47
00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:29.100
we would like to combine the advantages of
both of them, and that is why as I mentioned

48
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.819
in my last lecture.

49
00:07:30.819 --> 00:07:36.389
We shall be going for dynamic c MOS; that
means, the advantage of low power of static

50
00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:42.169
CMOS circuits and smaller chip area of n MOS
circuits or pseudo-n MOS circuits they are

51
00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:49.060
same are combined in dynamic circuits leading
to circuits of smaller area lower and lower

52
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:55.760
power dissipation; that means, you are achieving
both. And also as I mentioned MOS dynamic

53
00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:03.860
circuits are also faster in speed. And in
the static combinational circuits the capacitance

54
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:10.379
is regard as a parameter responsible for poor
performance of the circuit and therefore,

55
00:08:10.379 --> 00:08:15.590
considered as an undesirable circuit element.
We have seen that while discussing static

56
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:23.949
CMOS circuit that delay is large, because
of larger capacitance. So, the capacitance

57
00:08:23.949 --> 00:08:32.419
larger capacitances or presence of capacitances
is to be a menace, because of capacitance

58
00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:38.100
there is delay and delay is longer if the
capacitance is larger.

59
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:44.830
Now, the question arises can the capacitance
I am talking about the parasitic capacitances

60
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:52.510
that is present in the circuit, can be used
fruitfully can be used can it be used for

61
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:59.670
good cause. So, far it is associated with
with delay of a circuit, but is there any

62
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:07.680
way by which the capacitances can be utilized
to achieve functionality of the circuit which

63
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:13.480
is superior in performance. In fact, that
is where the dynamic CMOS comes in in dynamic

64
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:23.910
CMOS the capacitator which is present within
the MOS circuits we have seen that the that

65
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:32.160
get to substrate or get to channel capacitance.
That capacitance is of very good quality,

66
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:37.740
because of good quality silicon dioxide layer
that is created thin oxide layer that is created

67
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:44.580
and that capacitance we shall exploit or utilize
how.

68
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:51.740
We know that a capacitor can be used to store
charge. So, since a capacitor can be used

69
00:09:51.740 --> 00:10:00.250
to store charge can we develop circuit for
the capacitor intrinsic capacitor should be

70
00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:07.910
used to store charge and that will be used
for implementing circuit operation. And in

71
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:15.240
fact, we shall see that dynamic circuits exactly
does that dynamic MOS circuits are realized

72
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:23.790
by using parasitic capacitors to store information.
This is also done in a in a memory elements

73
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:32.420
as you know dynamic ram that is used in almost
all systems, they are also these the capacitors

74
00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:38.820
are utilized to store information, but here
we are talking about realizing combinational

75
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:45.519
circuit, by storing information in those parasitic
capacitors.

76
00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:53.480
Question naturally arises are they free from
any disadvantages; obviously, in this world

77
00:10:53.480 --> 00:11:00.600
nothing is one sided we shall as we shall
see, it will be dynamic CMOS circuits have

78
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:06.560
many advantages there will be many limitations
as well. So, our objective will be to design

79
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:14.680
circuits which will overcome the limitations
and utilize the good features.

80
00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:21.139
So, let us proceed to discuss about dynamic
circuits to start with we shall discuss about

81
00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:30.300
single-phase dynamic circuits although single-phase
dynamic circuits are not not very common,

82
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:38.079
but for the sake of completeness and for pedagogical
purposes. I shall start our discussion we

83
00:11:38.079 --> 00:11:45.329
shall start our discussions about single-phase
dynamic circuits. One very important point

84
00:11:45.329 --> 00:11:52.800
to be noticed at the outset that a dynamic
circuit will require some clock. So, far we

85
00:11:52.800 --> 00:12:01.829
have seen that either nMOS or pseudo-nMOS
or static CMOS circuits do not require any

86
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:07.710
clock for their operation. So, clock was not
present particularly when we are realizing

87
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:12.820
combinational circuit, but as we shall see
dynamic circuits will always require some

88
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:13.820
clock.

89
00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:34.560
So, if an in case of your single-phase
dynamic MOS circuit you will require some

90
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:43.009
clock. What do you really mean, by clock or
how do you characterize a clock. You will

91
00:12:43.009 --> 00:12:49.290
be encountering a clock in any digital circuits
how do you characterize it you will see that

92
00:12:49.290 --> 00:13:01.440
clock is essentially, a train of pulses like
this

93
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:13.790
one important feature is the or parameter
is the time period t. So, time period is one

94
00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:21.920
parameter time period T or it there is another
parameter associated with time period that

95
00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:28.940
is your frequency frequency is equal to 1
by T. So, a clock is characterized by by its

96
00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:35.940
clock frequency. Now, in addition to that
within each cycle. So, this time period is

97
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:45.589
consider a single cycle and this is repeated
uh repeated continuously. So, if you look

98
00:13:45.589 --> 00:13:53.990
at one particular time period you see that
there are two states associated with it one

99
00:13:53.990 --> 00:14:07.149
is your high, and another is low so; that
means, there are two states what are the two

100
00:14:07.149 --> 00:14:15.430
states high and low.
So, these are the two important states which

101
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:21.389
are used to activate circuits. And whenever
it is associated with these voltage levels

102
00:14:21.389 --> 00:14:30.110
high voltage level and and low voltage level
we call it level sensitive; that means, the

103
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:37.050
circuit is level sensitive whenever it is
a change occurs whenever the circuit is high

104
00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:44.240
level or low level depending on that the operation
changes. Another characteristic parameter

105
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:52.830
is also there you know there is you can see
each period has got two transitions low to

106
00:14:52.830 --> 00:15:02.060
high and high to low. And these are called
edge sensitive. They are circuits which are

107
00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:16.940
sensitive to edge; that means, here low to
high and high to low. So, there are two edges

108
00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:26.480
in each period. So, the events can occur or
can be initiated either by changing level

109
00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:32.910
or by changing edges. So, for as the MOS dynamic
circuits are concern as we shall see these

110
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:38.649
are level sensitive; that means, based on
level the operation of the circuit changes.

111
00:15:38.649 --> 00:15:51.139
Let us draw a very simple single-phase dynamic
MOS inverter. How do you realize an inverter,

112
00:15:51.139 --> 00:16:01.649
actually you realize you require two transistors
connected in this phone, and here you apply

113
00:16:01.649 --> 00:16:11.500
a clock say this clock in simple form we usually
write is c l clock clock is applied and here

114
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:19.339
we apply Vdd then we have the traditional
pull down transistor present here, this is

115
00:16:19.339 --> 00:16:25.980
your pull down transistor and we apply an
input here, and we take the output not from

116
00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:32.990
here, but from this point.
So, here is the output point. So, V out and

117
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:38.000
of course, it will have some associated capacitance
as you know, because it is feeding to a next

118
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:50.690
stage and which may be a MOS transistor. So,
it is it is going to the next stage. How it

119
00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:58.279
works based on the single-phase clock you
have applied a clock here, and you have applied

120
00:16:58.279 --> 00:17:03.560
input here, and you are taking the output
from here. How it works when this clock is

121
00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:16.220
high these transistors q 1 and q 2 both are
on. So, when the clock is high both the transistors

122
00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:23.200
run, and an as a consequence what will happen
what get at the output.

123
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:32.450
Whenever clock is high and input let us assume
there are two conditions your V in is equal

124
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:40.750
to 0 volt. Whenever V in is equal to 0 this
transistor is off, as a consequence what will

125
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:49.720
happen this capacitor this load capacitor
c l will charge to Vdd through these two transistors

126
00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:55.250
and you have applied a clock here. So, these
two transistors will remain on. Of course

127
00:17:55.250 --> 00:18:04.039
here you will get a voltage which is equal
to Vdd minus V t not Vdd, because you know

128
00:18:04.039 --> 00:18:13.070
the transistor will go off as the voltage
goes above Vdd minus V t V t is the threshold

129
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:17.850
voltage of the n MOS transistor. So, you are
getting a high level voltage which is Vdd

130
00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:27.360
minus V t. Now what about the case now if
you whenever the clock is going down; that

131
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:32.890
means, whenever it is in the low level then
what happens, then what happens the voltage

132
00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:39.350
which is the capacitor which is charged to
Vdd minus V t that remains there.

133
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:43.830
That remains that is available here which
we will feed to the next stage; that means,

134
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:49.710
next stage we utilize this logic level; that
means, it is assumed that output is now Vdd

135
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:59.950
minus V t; that means, V out is equal to Vdd
minus V t which is consider to be high because

136
00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:09.120
input is low. Now, let us consider the situation
when V in is equal to say 5 volt or Vdd then

137
00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:14.460
what will happen whenever it is Vdd. Then
you can see these transistors are on this

138
00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:18.720
transistor is also non on what will be the
voltage here, voltage will be dependent on

139
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:26.110
the ratio of the w y l of this transistor
and w y l of this transistor. So, the behavior

140
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:37.960
is identical to that of you know static n
MOS circuits. So, we get a V out which is

141
00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:45.020
equal to V low of course, this is not zero
which will be dependent on the ratio of the

142
00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:51.270
l by w ratio of these transistor and that
is why we can say that this is a this is a

143
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:56.870
this is ratioed logic.
Now, what is the gain that we have achieved

144
00:19:56.870 --> 00:20:02.760
in this case, gain is that what you can do
you can make this period; that means, high

145
00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:08.450
level very small. I mean, this period can
be small this this I mean high level small

146
00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:14.910
and low level longer, by that what will what
will you achieve you will achieve that power

147
00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:20.860
dissipation will occur; that means, this power
dissipation can occur only when this clock

148
00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:28.450
is high. Earlier respective of the presence
of clock as long as output was low, there

149
00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:33.230
was power dissipation in static CMOS a static
n MOS circuits, but in this particular case

150
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:38.809
only when the output is high. I mean, clock
is high and the output is low then there is

151
00:20:38.809 --> 00:20:44.530
static power dissipation. So, the static power
dissipation is reduced to a great extent,

152
00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:50.460
but there is static power dissipation and
it is ratioed logic, but the static power

153
00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:57.919
dissipation is much lower compared to your
static nMOS circuits or pseudo-nMOS circuits;

154
00:20:57.919 --> 00:21:04.190
however, you do not get good quality high
level and good quality low level both the

155
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:10.890
levels are you know are weak not strong high
or strong low.

156
00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:18.950
So, these circuits are not very popular, because
of these limitations and although for this

157
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:24.130
say sake of completeness we are discussing
it. And In fact, not only inverter you can

158
00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:30.120
realized NAND gate as you can see only requirement
is that you will require additional transistors

159
00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:36.039
in the pMOS nMOS network pull down network.
So, to input NAND gate we will require two

160
00:21:36.039 --> 00:21:41.770
transistors to neither input nor gate we will
require two transistors in this way the number

161
00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:55.070
of transistors that is required is equal to
n plus 2. So, n number of transistors for

162
00:21:55.070 --> 00:22:02.240
the n inputs, and two transistors are required
these two transistors q 1 and q 2. So, these

163
00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:07.120
two additional transistors are required apart
from n transistors where primary inputs are

164
00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:12.960
applied. So, you see the number of transistors
is reduced. So, these circuits will be faster

165
00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:23.710
than static cMOS; however, we have discussed
various limitations of this.

166
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:29.470
As I mentioned circuits realized using single-phase
clock scheme, clocking scheme has the disadvantage

167
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:35.140
that the output voltage level is dependent
on the inverter ratio. And the number of transistors

168
00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:40.860
in the current part to ground moreover. The
circuit dissipates power when the output is

169
00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:47.559
low and the clock is high as I mention and
as current flows only when the clock is high

170
00:22:47.559 --> 00:22:53.700
the power consumption is reduced and it depends
on the duty cycle ratio of the high high time

171
00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:59.029
to the time period as I mentioned here. So,
this is the time period T and this is let

172
00:22:59.029 --> 00:23:05.309
us assume this is the this is T 1. So, power
dissipation will be dependent on the ratio

173
00:23:05.309 --> 00:23:14.570
of T 1 by T and if T 1 is small compared to
T 1 by T then power dissipation will be smaller.

174
00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:20.900
Another problem arising out of single-phase
clocked logic is known as clock skew problem

175
00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:25.820
for the timing we are not discussing clock
skew problem later on we shall discuss about

176
00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:32.039
it in more detail, and let us now switch to
two-phase dynamic circuits.

177
00:23:32.039 --> 00:23:44.190
Now, before we discuss about two-phase dynamic
circuits two-phase. What do you really mean

178
00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:48.880
by two-phase, before we come to the dynamic
circuits let us discuss about what do you

179
00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:55.539
really mean by two-phase. In two-phase you
will find that there are two clocks not one.

180
00:23:55.539 --> 00:24:03.210
So; that means, you will be having a clock
phi one another clock phi two. So, and they

181
00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:13.500
will have some this kind of relationship phi
1 this is phi 1 and phi 2 will be like this

182
00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:24.890
they are called non overlapping. By non overlapping
we mean, they are never simultaneously on;

183
00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:34.880
that means, phi one bar phi 2 is always 0
as you can see; that means, when phi 1 is

184
00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:43.120
1 phi 2 is 0 and when phi 2 is 1 phi 1 is
0. So, what are the different states it can

185
00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:50.419
have of course, it will have the time period
and frequency like single-phase, but in addition

186
00:24:50.419 --> 00:24:57.120
to that what are the other features of a two-phase
dynamic two-phase clock number one it has

187
00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:08.190
got three states.
Normally whenever you have got two clocks

188
00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:19.390
you are supposed to get four states 0 0 1
1 1 0 and 0 1, but here you can see you cannot

189
00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:27.340
really have the state when both of them are
one; that means, here you will have 1 and

190
00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:41.190
0; that means, phi 1 is 1 phi 2 is 0. You
can have phi 2 1 sorry phi 2 0 phi 1 phi phi

191
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:48.580
1 0 phi 2 1, you can have both of them 0 as
well for the during this the period both of

192
00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:57.110
them 0, but in this case you will never get
1 1; that means, this is not allowed in dynamic

193
00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:01.780
in two-phase clock, and that is the reason
why it is called two-phase clock.

194
00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:07.309
So, two-phase clock is associated with three
states, it is characterize by three states

195
00:26:07.309 --> 00:26:17.080
and a and this can be used to realize two-phase
dynamic circuits. Question naturally arises

196
00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:25.250
how do you realize two-phase clock, because
how do you ensure that both of them will never

197
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:33.100
be 1. So, you will require some circuit special
type of circuit which can be used to realize

198
00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:40.429
a dynamic to realize two-phase clock. Let
me draw a very simple diagram which can be

199
00:26:40.429 --> 00:26:53.990
used to realize two-phase clock. You will
require

200
00:26:53.990 --> 00:27:13.529
two NAND gates and several several inverters
and this is connected to this point and this

201
00:27:13.529 --> 00:27:22.309
is connected to this point.
So, here if you apply clock here you will

202
00:27:22.309 --> 00:27:29.550
get phi 1 and here you will get phi 2 let
me briefly explain the operation of this circuit.

203
00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:45.019
Let us assume this is the clock this is the
clock and with respect to with the help of

204
00:27:45.019 --> 00:27:50.860
this clock we have generated phi 1 and phi
2 which are non overlapping in nature. And

205
00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:57.880
how they are becoming non overlapping and
what will be the gap between this time and

206
00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:02.840
this time; that means, when it is going low
it is going high or whenever it is going high

207
00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:07.529
and this one is going low, these durations
these durations are important. So, they should

208
00:28:07.529 --> 00:28:14.220
be separated by some gap called band gap.
And let us see how it really happens lets

209
00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:19.390
such initially let’s say here we have assumed
that the clock is 0. So, whenever this is

210
00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:26.820
0 what will be the output here, for a NAND
gate as you know respective of the number

211
00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:30.340
of inputs if any one of the input is 0 output
will be 1.

212
00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:38.120
So, since this is 0 this will be 1 this will
be 0 this will be 1 and this will be zero;

213
00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:45.230
that means, we are getting that it phi one
is also 0 when clock is 0 phi one is also

214
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:55.850
0. What about phi 2 here this since this is
0 this is 1, and here also it is 1. So, 1

215
00:28:55.850 --> 00:29:07.620
makes it 0 this is one this is 0 and this
is 1. So, as expected the phi 2 is high. So,

216
00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:18.300
here it is low and here it is high. Now, at
this point it has switched from low to high.

217
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:27.860
So, as it switches from low to high that is
1. What happens whenever it switches to 0

218
00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:35.039
to 1 this will switch to 1 to 0 after 1 gate
delay, and as you know for a non gate a NAND

219
00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:39.950
gate whenever any one of the input is 0 output
will immediately change. So, this will change

220
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:48.700
to 0 to 1 this will change to 1 to 0, this
will change to 0 to 1, this will change to

221
00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:57.410
1 to 0 after how much time say how many got
gate delays 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 after 5 gate delays

222
00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:02.070
phi 2 is become phi 2 is going phi 2 is becoming
low.

223
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:15.980
So, let us assume this is the 5 gate delay
after 5 gate delay this will go low. Then

224
00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:23.340
as you can see here, this is now 1 and this
is also 1 these two will make it 0 this will

225
00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:30.840
make it one this will make it 0 and this will
make it 1. So, this will switch to 1, but

226
00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:39.700
how after how much time after this has become
say this has become 1 and this is already

227
00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:45.390
1. So, when both of them becomes one after
that one two three four; that means, here

228
00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:57.010
it will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 after 8
gate delays this will switch from 1 to 0 earlier

229
00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:03.760
it was one now it will become it has become
0. So, it will become 8 gate delays. So, this

230
00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:15.679
is 5 delta and here will be another 3 delta
when it will go from low to high.

231
00:31:15.679 --> 00:31:25.059
And this will continue until another change
occurs here. So, whenever again it switches

232
00:31:25.059 --> 00:31:33.960
from 1 to 0 I mean, 1 to 0 it is switching
now to 0. And as it switches to 0 this will

233
00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:40.799
now change from 0 to 1 since this is 0 it
will become 1 again this will become 0 this

234
00:31:40.799 --> 00:31:47.600
will become 1 this will become 0, but after
how much time. So, we can see as it is changing

235
00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:57.010
from this input is changing from 1 to 0 here
1, 2, 3, 4 after 4 gate delays it will become

236
00:31:57.010 --> 00:32:10.510
0; that means, phi 1 will become 0 from this
edge after 4 gate delays. And as it has happen

237
00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:17.470
this becomes 1 this is also 1, again after
three gate delays up from that it will become

238
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:26.990
switch it will switch to 1; that means, this
will switch to 1 after 3 gate delays from

239
00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:34.221
this 3 gate delays and this will continue.
So, we can see here we have got 5 gate delay

240
00:32:34.221 --> 00:32:44.429
here 3 gate delay here 4 gate delay here and
this to this it is sorry not this 1, this

241
00:32:44.429 --> 00:32:52.471
to this 4 gate delay and from this edge to
actually it should be here 3 delta. So, we

242
00:32:52.471 --> 00:33:01.179
find that in this particular case here, there
is a gap of 3 gate delay here also there is

243
00:33:01.179 --> 00:33:06.039
gap of 3 gate delay here. Similarly, for the
other case also there will be 3 gate delay;

244
00:33:06.039 --> 00:33:14.080
that means, this part this one the gap between
these two edges will be 3 delta gap between

245
00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:18.789
these two edges will be 3 delta gap between
these two edges will be three delta gap between

246
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:23.730
these two edges will be 3 delta.
So, this is how you can realize a two-phase

247
00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:32.139
clock with the help of few inverters two NAND
gates from a single-phase clock. You may say

248
00:33:32.139 --> 00:33:39.279
say you may ask that suppose we are not satisfied
with a 3 delta band gap between the two-phase

249
00:33:39.279 --> 00:33:45.330
clocks. Then what you can do you can insert
more number of inverters here, say instead

250
00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:52.170
of 3 you can have 5 here then this will become
this gap will be 5 delta 5 delta 5 delta and

251
00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:59.120
so on. So, depending on your requirement you
can increase the gap between the two-phase

252
00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:05.269
clocks, but that non overlapping property
will be always maintained whenever you will

253
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:12.649
generate two-phase clock by using this technique.
So, much about two-phase clock. So, here we

254
00:34:12.649 --> 00:34:19.760
have shown the same thing and how continuously
you will get two-phase clock phi 1 and phi

255
00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:25.168
2 maintaining 3 gate delays at both edges
here also 3 get delay three get delay and

256
00:34:25.168 --> 00:34:26.168
so on.

257
00:34:26.168 --> 00:34:37.029
Now, let us see how we can use this two-phase
clock to realize a two-phase dynamic circuit

258
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:50.590
let us consider a two-phase dynamic nMOS inverter.

259
00:34:50.590 --> 00:35:05.350
So, this will require 3 transistors; that
means, here you will apply phi 2 here, you

260
00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:12.180
will apply phi 1 this is connected to ground,
this is connected to Vdd and V into input

261
00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:19.020
is applied here, and you will be taking output
from here V out. And as usual to explain the

262
00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:24.290
operation of the circuit we shall assume that
there is a load capacitance associated with

263
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:32.401
it. Now, let us try to explain the operation
of the circuit. The operation of the circuit

264
00:35:32.401 --> 00:35:40.000
can be explained with the help of what is
known as precharged logic precharged logic.

265
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:56.260
So, when phi 2 is 1 the output and; obviously,
that time phi 1 is phi 1 phi 1 is 0, when

266
00:35:56.260 --> 00:36:03.130
phi 2 is 1 phi 1 is 0 that we have that we
have ensured, both of them can never be simultaneously

267
00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:06.980
1.
So, when this is the case what happens this

268
00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:18.230
out this transistor is on. So, this will charge
to the output will charge to Vdd minus V t

269
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:36.860
high level output will charge to high level.
So, this is called precharged phase. So, during

270
00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:43.860
the precharged phase when phi is phi 2 is
1; that means, when phi 2 is 1 the output

271
00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:57.740
is charging to high level this is high. Now
whenever it switches to phi 2 to 0 and phi

272
00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:07.400
1 is equal to 1 in this condition this transistor
is off, and this transistor is on. When this

273
00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:15.121
is this is, so what will happen to this capacitor
this if V in depending on V that now you can

274
00:37:15.121 --> 00:37:25.080
have two conditions this is this is known
as evaluation phase evaluation phase.

275
00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:31.630
In this evaluation phase there are two possibilities
one possibility is that V in is equal to 0,

276
00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:37.920
and another possibility is V in is equal to
Vdd. Let us consider when V in is equal to

277
00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:43.890
0 when V in is equal to 0 this transistor
is off and although phi 2 is 1 this transistor

278
00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:56.070
is on there is no path to dispatch this capacitor
so; that means, V out is equal to Vdd I mean

279
00:37:56.070 --> 00:38:04.940
is high V out is equal to high why it is high,
because which the capacitor has is already

280
00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:10.860
charged to high level during the precharged
phase. And the evaluation phase follows the

281
00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:16.330
precharged phase and as a consequence the
high level is maintained during evaluation

282
00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:22.280
phase and which will be used by the next stage.
So, after evaluation after the evaluation

283
00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:26.780
is done a valued output is available which
will be used by the next stage.

284
00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:33.180
Now, let us assume V in is equal to Vdd. When
V in is equal to Vdd both the transistors

285
00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:41.200
are on and capacitor will discharge to 0 logic
level so; that means, in that case V out will

286
00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:48.180
be equal to 0 or low logic level. So, here
of course, you will get strong low logic level.

287
00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:56.140
So, what is the advantage of this circuit
we are able to get two possible outputs and

288
00:38:56.140 --> 00:39:01.700
of course, high logic level is not very good,
but low logic level is good, because it is

289
00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:09.691
not ratioed logic. Number one this two-phase
dynamic circuit is not ratioed logic. There

290
00:39:09.691 --> 00:39:18.350
is no static power dissipation. So, let us
list the advantages and disadvantages.

291
00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:28.330
So, maybe we can discuss about the advantages
and disadvantages very quickly before we come

292
00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:42.030
to other circuits advantages it is not ratioed
logic. So, disadvantages associated with ratioed

293
00:39:42.030 --> 00:40:03.510
logic is overcome no static power dissipation.
Third is faster much faster than either pseudo-n

294
00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:14.600
MOS or static CMOS and number of transistors
as we have seen is equal to n plus two number

295
00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:25.990
of transistors is equal to n plus 2.
So, these are the advantages of this two-phase

296
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:31.610
dynamics n MOS circuit. So, we find that it
has got very good features and that is the

297
00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:45.320
reason why it is called powerless ratio less
powerless, because there is no static power

298
00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:51.150
dissipation and ratio less, because it is
not rationed logic and of course, it is faster

299
00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:58.540
in operation. So, these two-phase dynamic
n MOS inverter is has got very good features

300
00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:04.290
and it is widely used; however, you are more
interested in u h CMOS circuits.

301
00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:10.760
So, we can realize dynamic CMOS circuits by
extending the idea of static CMOS and here,

302
00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:21.070
as you can see how we can do that. Whenever
we are using uh statics I mean, by dynamic

303
00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:29.520
circuits by using CMOS instead of the nMOS
transistor let me redraw it again.

304
00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:42.530
Instead of using dynamic CMOS inverter let
me draw inverter before we can draw the other

305
00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:47.430
cycles. So, in case of dynamic inverter what
you will require you will require a pMOS transistor

306
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:54.860
as pull up a pull down transistor nMOS transistor
for inverter where you will apply input voltage,

307
00:41:54.860 --> 00:42:08.220
and a nMOS transistor in the path to 0. So,
and what you can do you can apply a clock

308
00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:16.340
you do not really require two-phase clock
whenever you are realizing dynamic CMOS circuit

309
00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:21.900
the reason for that is you can see the same
if we apply the same signal to the pMOS and

310
00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:29.130
nMOS transistor, when p this phi is 0 this
transistor is on and when phi is 1 this transistor

311
00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:34.000
is on.
So, that the requirement for that that phi

312
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:40.570
1 and phi 2 should not be simultaneously on
is satisfied very easily. So, we do not really

313
00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:47.750
require two-phase clock in realizing dynamic
CMOS circuit. The operation is identical to

314
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:53.460
the inverter that we have discussed two-phase
dynamic n MOS inverter here, what happens

315
00:42:53.460 --> 00:43:06.060
when when phi 2 when phi is equal to 0, it
is in the precharge phase

316
00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:15.740
this output charges to high logic level. And
when phi phi is equal to 1 then it is called

317
00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:29.710
evaluation phase.
The output is evaluated depending on the input

318
00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:37.770
this V in. So, this is how you can realize
a dynamic CMOS inverter and all the advantages

319
00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:46.490
that I mention in the context of this two-phase
dynamic n MOS inverter are applicable to dynamic

320
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:51.220
CMOS inverter. It is not ratioed logic there
is no static power dissipation it is faster

321
00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:55.870
number of transistor required is equal to
n plus 2 and it is also powerless and ratio

322
00:43:55.870 --> 00:44:01.610
less. So, all the advantages are carried to
this dynamic CMOS inverter.

323
00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:09.210
You can realize dynamic CMOS inverter I mean,
extend this concept to realize more complex

324
00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:21.280
gates. Let us consider a first of all static
CMOS and we shall see real we shall consider

325
00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:29.070
the realization dynamic CMOS circuits corresponding
to that. Let us assume that it is little complex

326
00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:56.280
circuit. So, you have got say x 1, x 2, x
3 and then you have got x 1, x 2, x 3 connected

327
00:44:56.280 --> 00:45:06.350
to down. So, this is your static CMOS circuits
we want a dynamic CMOS circuit which is which

328
00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:12.530
performs the same function. What we can do
you will you may use you can see as I mentioned

329
00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:20.421
earlier you are repeating two logic circuits
to realize the function we shall see we can

330
00:45:20.421 --> 00:45:26.020
use only one of them to realize a dynamic
CMOS circuit

331
00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:33.130
Let us see how we can realize this function
by using only the n MOS network circuit. So,

332
00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:50.620
what will you do you can realize the dynamic
CMOS circuits x 1, x 2, x 3 and here you will

333
00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:56.380
put one nMOS transistor and here you will
put one p MOS transistor and you will apply

334
00:45:56.380 --> 00:46:03.960
clock here. So, you can see you do not have
really duplicate the logic function here you

335
00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:10.950
will require only the nMOS network part which
is present here to realize the dynamic CMOS

336
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:15.660
circuit. Of course, you will require two additional
transistor that is here you will require n

337
00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:23.330
plus two transistors instead of two n as you
require in static CMOS. Now is it the only

338
00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:34.000
way to realize dynamic CMOS circuit, actually
you can use either the n MOS network or the

339
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:43.410
p MOS network here. The circuit that has been
realized is using the n MOS network.

340
00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:52.380
What you can do you can use the same you can
realize the same circuit by using the p MOS

341
00:46:52.380 --> 00:47:03.910
network. So, in that case the topology will
be like this

342
00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:22.800
same network x 1, then x 2, x 3, but you will
require again two transistors one at the bottom

343
00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:32.520
and another the top. So, you will apply phi
bar you will apply phi or you can apply phi

344
00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:38.000
bar actually. Now, where from you will take
the output here you were taking the output

345
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:45.290
from here. So, this was your V out, but whenever
used pMOS network in that case you have to

346
00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:51.250
take the output from the this point bottom;
that means, V out is from here how this circuit

347
00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:59.180
operates here actually again it is based on
precharge approach, but instead of precharging

348
00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:05.310
the output to high level as you do it here
you are actually predischarging the output

349
00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:12.500
to low level in this particular case; that
means, whenever you are using the pMOS network

350
00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:20.230
then the output is predischarged during the
precharged phase; that means, this transistor

351
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:26.130
is on you have applied phi bar. So, this transistor
will be on when this is high.

352
00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:33.520
Or phi is equal to 0. So, when this is high
this transistor will be discharged during

353
00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:38.520
precharged phase that is being done. So, this
is discharged to 0 and during evaluation what

354
00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:45.700
will happen depending on the input combinations
input vector; that means, depending on the

355
00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:55.320
values of x 1, x 2 and x 3, you can uh this
output will be charged to high level if the

356
00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:59.710
input combination is such the output should
be high in that case if there’ll be a path

357
00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:05.180
through this through this network during the
evaluation phase when this transistor is on

358
00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:10.230
and the there will be path through this pMOS
network. So, this will in the during evaluation

359
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:18.840
phase it will charged to Vdd level.
But if the if the output is 0 then it will

360
00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:24.220
remain in that pre-discharged condition, it
will not charged to V v d level. So, you can

361
00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:31.430
see we have two possible alternatives whenever
we realize circuits using dynamic CMOS approach

362
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:38.400
either you can use the n MOS network or you
can use the p MOS network, but you do not

363
00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:45.530
have to duplicate; that means, use this as
well as that as you do in case of static CMOS

364
00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:54.200
and you may have been asking which one will
be faster and of course, the network I mean

365
00:49:54.200 --> 00:50:01.470
the topology using nMOS network could be faster
with the same area, because as you know the

366
00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:08.040
pMOS transistors will take uh will take longer
time, because of higher resistance and lower

367
00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:13.990
mobility of the holes compared to electrons
an as a consequence for the same area the

368
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:20.860
this particular topology will be requiring
larger time it will be slower than this one.

369
00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:26.590
However both are used later on we shall see
both can be combined in realizing a special

370
00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:34.660
type of circuit there later on we shall discuss
about it for the time being let us restrict

371
00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:37.030
to this now very quickly.

372
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:45.510
Let us have a look at the disadvantages advantages
and disadvantages. As I have already mentioned,

373
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:51.970
the number of transistors required for a circuit
with fan-in N is N plus 2 in contrast to 2N

374
00:50:51.970 --> 00:50:57.750
in case of static CMOS circuits. The load
capacitance is more than 50 percent less than

375
00:50:57.750 --> 00:51:03.260
static CMOS and is closer to that of nMOS
circuits as a consequence it is faster. So,

376
00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:08.180
the speed of operation is faster than that
of static CMOS circuits about 4 to 5 times

377
00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:14.140
faster as we have we have found that; and
there is no static power dissipation and another

378
00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:18.460
important point is there is no short circuit
power dissipation, why there is no short circuit

379
00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:24.320
power dissipation, because at no point of
time there is path from Vdd to ground even

380
00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:30.670
when the input changes, because it is controlled
by clock and as a consequence it is since

381
00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:37.270
it is controlled by clock, there will be no
path from V d to would to V d to ground at

382
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:42.380
any point of time, and as consequence there
is no short circuit power dissipation.

383
00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:46.880
And later on we shall see that it has got
no glitching power dissipation why it has

384
00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:52.330
got no glitching power dissipation. As you
know glitching power dissipation occurs because

385
00:51:52.330 --> 00:51:58.510
of you know changes at the output within the
circuit, because of the delay of the circuit,

386
00:51:58.510 --> 00:52:05.020
but here it is more or less synchronized by
clock and only one transition is possible

387
00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:09.350
you know after it has been precharged only
transition that can occur is from high to

388
00:52:09.350 --> 00:52:15.620
low no other transition is possible, but in
case of static CMOS circuits the particular

389
00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:22.690
node can go through number of charging and
discharging before attempting the final value

390
00:52:22.690 --> 00:52:32.740
and as a consequence the glitching power dissipation
is not present in dynamic CMOS circuits.

391
00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:38.900
And as a consequence the dynamic CMOS circuits
have been found to be very suitable, because

392
00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:48.310
of theirs higher speed of operation and lower
area. In fact, one of the very important processor

393
00:52:48.310 --> 00:52:54.460
dekalpha chip you may have heard of it that
dekalpha processor was one of the fastest

394
00:52:54.460 --> 00:53:02.920
processor I mean introduced long back and
there they have used about 30 percent of their

395
00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:09.190
circuits using dynamic CMOS. Essentially the
critical parts of the circuits were implemented

396
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:15.240
by using dynamic CMOS circuit. So, that they
can achieve very high speed of operation any

397
00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:21.240
way those are the advantages and based on
those advantages this is done, but there are

398
00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:23.410
several disadvantages.

399
00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:29.260
Number one is charge leakage problem, number
two is charge sharing problem and third is

400
00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:37.210
clock skew problem. So, these are the three
problems associated with dynamic CMOS circuits.

401
00:53:37.210 --> 00:53:45.310
And in my next lecture, I shall discuss about
these disadvantages, and also we shall discuss

402
00:53:45.310 --> 00:53:51.280
about how they can be overcome. Obviously,
if we accept the disadvantages, then we cannot

403
00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:56.780
realize a circuit, we have to develop technique
by which these limitations and disadvantages

404
00:53:56.780 --> 00:54:00.690
can be overcome, and which we shall discuss
in my next lecture thank you.
