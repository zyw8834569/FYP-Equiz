1
00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.960
this conference will now be recorded

2
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.920
okay so fine so today we discussed the

3
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.240
some digital technique how to design

4
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.560
some digital circuits based on

5
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.160
the static cmos what is the static cmos

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.480
i will discuss on today so now suppose

7
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.199
that

8
00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.439
actually one expression is there one is

9
00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.640
expression is suppose that

10
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.240
okay very simple expression i taken

11
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.558
first and then we go for some higher

12
00:00:32.558 --> 00:00:35.520
level uh suppose that i design the

13
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.559
circuit in

14
00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.600
that is a nand so

15
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.640
how to design this nand gate circuit at

16
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.879
the cmos level

17
00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.239
so the only uh three uh

18
00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.160
two step is there in the two step you

19
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.920
have to design

20
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.360
any type of digital circuits

21
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.680
so the first step is suppose that the

22
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.879
first step is

23
00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.399
your boolean expression must be

24
00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.800
available suppose that in case of

25
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.080
land gate your logic is a b whole bar

26
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.920
okay so so this is a available

27
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.240
expression this is expression

28
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.320
label so now how to convert this

29
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.200
boolean expression to this logic to this

30
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.000
uh

31
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.119
transistor level design okay so what is

32
00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.080
the process

33
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.360
uh what process so now we go for the

34
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.400
fundamentals and we have to design this

35
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.079
type of architecture

36
00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.320
okay just to remember this concept i

37
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.400
just uh tell you

38
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.159
in k actually the static cmos

39
00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.360
is a two block one block and another

40
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.720
block

41
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.320
okay so this block is connected to bdt

42
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.240
and this block is connected to ground

43
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.680
okay this is the first block this is the

44
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.240
second block and now here the gate is

45
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.360
common if suppose that this is a gate

46
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.240
and here you take the output okay so the

47
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.719
output is denoted by y

48
00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.759
so so this is a general architecture

49
00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.480
available in all that cmos circuit

50
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.920
okay so this is a general architecture

51
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.920
architecture is available in all the

52
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.959
digital

53
00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.280
or all cmos level circuits if you talk

54
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.319
about the cmos

55
00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.560
so cmos is a combination pmos and nmos

56
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.120
so now block

57
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.319
is known as a pull-up network this

58
00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.519
block is known as a pull up and this

59
00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.519
lower side block if you talk about the

60
00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.360
lower side block

61
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.800
this is the pull down okay

62
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.160
this is a pull down so so you know

63
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.720
very very well the pmos the pull-up

64
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.319
transistor is designed by pmos

65
00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.800
the pmos is the sample is like this

66
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.440
okay now here what is pull down pull

67
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.920
down is

68
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.680
actually is a and mos transistor

69
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.000
in all in all the case your nmos is

70
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.120
connected to ground

71
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.120
source is connected to ground in case of

72
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.159
nmos transistor

73
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.480
okay but here if you talked about the

74
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.400
pull up network pull-up network is a

75
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.840
pmos

76
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.920
this is your pmos and this source is

77
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.879
connected to vdd

78
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.280
source is connected to vdd so these are

79
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.200
the fundamental

80
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.720
fundamental things you already know the

81
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.239
pull-up network is a pmos

82
00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.360
and the pull down network is a

83
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.120
transistor but now my objective is we

84
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.599
design

85
00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.640
a digital circuit based on the cmos

86
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.680
logic

87
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.680
so all the cmos logic circuits is

88
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.440
actually based on this type of

89
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.120
architecture

90
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.480
in this block you design some circuit

91
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.319
may be series connection or maybe

92
00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.239
parallel connection

93
00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.280
and also in the blog two you design some

94
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.159
circuit

95
00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.360
may be nmos maybe series or parallel

96
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.200
so we discuss later how to

97
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.599
how to consider this is a series

98
00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.040
connection and this is a parallel

99
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.640
connection

100
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.839
what is the concept behind that but now

101
00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:18.399
you just

102
00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:22.160
understand in all the cmos circuits

103
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.880
it actually design this type of

104
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.080
architecture

105
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.160
what is a pull-up and there is a

106
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.440
pull-down

107
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.280
and the pull network pull-up network is

108
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.800
connected to vdd

109
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.720
and the pull-down network is connected

110
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.040
ground and this is a common connection

111
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.400
this is a gate

112
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.560
and this is output okay

113
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.919
so that is clear it is no any issue

114
00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.960
but now we go for the pull up

115
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.520
and pull down network how to design the

116
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.759
pull up and pull down network

117
00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.919
based on the boolean expression based on

118
00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.639
the available boolean expression

119
00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.320
so here in this logic land logic your

120
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.479
boolean expression is available a b

121
00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.680
whole bar whole bar

122
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.320
so this is my expression and the my

123
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.440
architecture is only

124
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.199
if you divide this circuit in a two

125
00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:16.479
block

126
00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.240
this is a pull up okay i i

127
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.600
designed two circuit only i designed two

128
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.560
model rule on

129
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.840
one module is a pull-up

130
00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:32.560
in in this down i design pull down

131
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.759
okay so so uh so that is okay

132
00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:40.400
in the upside we design the pull up and

133
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.479
in the downside we design the pull

134
00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.919
down network

135
00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:51.440
okay so that is clear but now we design

136
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.759
what is the action type maybe series

137
00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:55.039
connection

138
00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:57.840
or maybe parallel connection may be

139
00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.919
series connection or maybe parallel

140
00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:03.360
connection so based on the availability

141
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.560
of the boolean

142
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.840
boolean expression

143
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.840
so based on the availability of the

144
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.800
boolean expression

145
00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:18.840
we have to decide the pull-up pull-down

146
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.120
network

147
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.160
so now we go for the designing part

148
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.960
how to design the pull-up and how to

149
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.479
design the pull-down

150
00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:32.240
network so you know in this side

151
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.319
if you divide the circuit in two part

152
00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:36.240
two part in this side

153
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.280
we design some circuit in this side

154
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.400
is also design some circuit

155
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.360
so in this side that is pull up network

156
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.560
in this side this is a

157
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.639
down network so that means here all the

158
00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:53.840
all the devices all the or whatever the

159
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.560
device

160
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.720
you are using in this side that is pull

161
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.160
up

162
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.840
so that means here pmos he required only

163
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.840
pmos

164
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.520
similarly in the sound network in this

165
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.960
side

166
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.840
in the downside you require pull down

167
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.840
the pull down network is designed by

168
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.360
nmos

169
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.800
okay so the design way and

170
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.400
moss so that that logic

171
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.759
we have to fix first in our mind

172
00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:30.800
now then you decide number of

173
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.759
transistors

174
00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:33.759
in case of pull up or in case of pull

175
00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:36.800
down how many times are required

176
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.560
and what is the connection whatever what

177
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.240
is the connection maybe there is or may

178
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:40.800
be

179
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.000
parallel okay so

180
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.560
now first we decide number of

181
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.599
transistors in

182
00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:50.639
in in my circuit designing my nand logic

183
00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:51.759
is available that

184
00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:55.199
none logic is a b whole bar

185
00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.319
okay so this is this logic we have to

186
00:07:58.319 --> 00:07:58.960
design

187
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.680
in case of cmos level okay so that is

188
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.800
that is clear only so first we decide to

189
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.680
part

190
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.520
one part is how many number of

191
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.280
transistors

192
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.759
and and what is the what is a type maybe

193
00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:14.400
series

194
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.599
or maybe panel so two thing we have to

195
00:08:17.599 --> 00:08:20.160
solve here

196
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.280
okay so just to understand in this

197
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.840
boolean expressions there is a two input

198
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.199
only your input is only a

199
00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:32.320
and b so at least you require

200
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.599
transistors uh means in the pull-up

201
00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:36.640
network or

202
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.479
network is equal number of transistors

203
00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:42.880
in case of a sigma circuit design or

204
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.040
static cmos circuit design

205
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.480
pull up this is a pull down

206
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.080
so in the pull up network how many

207
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.360
because in pull down network

208
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.959
we are using equal number of

209
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.480
the transistor is same okay

210
00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.680
so now here in this

211
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.880
upside if we talk about the upside

212
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.000
i require two transistor and in the

213
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.360
downside

214
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.959
i also require two dimensions

215
00:09:16.959 --> 00:09:19.279
okay so that is clear why because in the

216
00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:20.959
nand logic

217
00:09:20.959 --> 00:09:23.040
two input is there so that means you

218
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.240
require only

219
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.839
two dimensions okay so now

220
00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:32.000
we have to we have solved this problem

221
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.920
and second issue how to decide the

222
00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:36.720
connection

223
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.320
if if the true transistor is there

224
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.720
what is the connection maybe series or

225
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.560
may be parallel

226
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.680
so so what concept how to how to arrange

227
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.080
this

228
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.360
uh how do i take the transistors maybe

229
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.600
in series type or maybe in parallel

230
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.839
what is the logic or what is the concept

231
00:09:55.839 --> 00:09:57.680
behind this

232
00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.600
okay so now we go for here for the

233
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.440
concept how to design the

234
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.560
series of parallel connection okay so

235
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.000
please understand if

236
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.519
the logic is a b whole bar

237
00:10:11.839 --> 00:10:16.240
here first we concentrate this side

238
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.760
this is a pull down and this is designed

239
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.880
by only nmos transistors

240
00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.000
so here just you observe carefully

241
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.200
here you observe carefully

242
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.320
in case of n mass okay just i just you

243
00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:32.800
use this

244
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.440
table in case of cmos

245
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.839
you just observe in my boolean

246
00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:40.560
expression

247
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.920
in the available boolean expressions

248
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:49.360
what is this is a plus sign or dot sign

249
00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:53.040
if it is plus sign then you consider

250
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.399
this is the parallel connection

251
00:10:56.399 --> 00:10:59.760
if it is dot sign

252
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.079
then you consider the device

253
00:11:04.079 --> 00:11:07.120
in the series mode

254
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.120
and now in case of pmos

255
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.720
this operation is opposite

256
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.839
the plane is denoted here series and the

257
00:11:17.839 --> 00:11:18.560
dot

258
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.000
sign is denoted the parallel

259
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
why because the pmos is a compliment of

260
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.760
nmos

261
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.160
what is the rule in nmos if the opposite

262
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.440
rule are

263
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.600
the opposite rules are available on the

264
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.399
the rules are available on the pmos

265
00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:42.560
so in my endless logic in my nmos logic

266
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.200
my dots dots a plus sign represent the

267
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.040
parallel

268
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.519
and the dot sign and the dot sign

269
00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:52.639
represent the series

270
00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.000
but here in case of p mod the plus sign

271
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.120
represent the series

272
00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.320
opposite opposite behavior

273
00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.880
okay so so that is clear it is okay

274
00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.920
now if suppose that if the

275
00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:12.160
if this logic in this downside

276
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.760
just you observe here in this expression

277
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.800
the sign is there so what is the meaning

278
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.800
of dot here

279
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.839
just to see just to carefully uh

280
00:12:23.839 --> 00:12:26.079
observer

281
00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:29.360
dot means series connection

282
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.800
so series means both the transistors

283
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.360
both the tangents are connected in

284
00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.480
series

285
00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.720
this is a series connection because here

286
00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.720
the dot sign is available this dot sign

287
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.079
the meaning is

288
00:12:42.079 --> 00:12:44.959
it is in series

289
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.040
okay because here the plus sign is not

290
00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.079
there

291
00:12:50.079 --> 00:12:53.120
only dot sign so the meaning of dot sign

292
00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.120
the connection is series

293
00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.240
this is a series connection

294
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.079
okay so now my uh pull down network is

295
00:13:02.079 --> 00:13:03.120
complete

296
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.839
because we know this block this down

297
00:13:05.839 --> 00:13:08.880
block is a pull down

298
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.920
now we go for the pull up network design

299
00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.560
now we go for the pull up network design

300
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.519
so this is a pull up network

301
00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:23.279
okay so in case of pull out network

302
00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:26.320
in case of pull-up network

303
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.920
your device

304
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.839
using only pmos i think you know very

305
00:13:31.839 --> 00:13:33.040
well it is no way

306
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.240
you know very well uh

307
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.040
okay so just to observe carefully what

308
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.079
is my rule

309
00:13:40.079 --> 00:13:43.279
our rule is this all the time this rule

310
00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:44.399
is applicable

311
00:13:44.399 --> 00:13:47.519
to design any type of static

312
00:13:47.519 --> 00:13:50.320
logic circuits

313
00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.720
okay so here this part is complete now

314
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.920
we go for this part

315
00:13:56.079 --> 00:13:58.079
so just to observe here what is the sign

316
00:13:58.079 --> 00:13:59.920
dot sign here what is the dot

317
00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.560
dot means parallel so now in this

318
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:09.199
case your two transistors are indel

319
00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.959
to time is starting parallel in case of

320
00:14:12.959 --> 00:14:16.800
pull down network

321
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.959
okay so so that that so that is clear it

322
00:14:18.959 --> 00:14:20.399
is no any problem

323
00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:24.160
uh okay so here your again you know

324
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.320
if the pull down pull up network is

325
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.600
complete

326
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.160
then you apply a vdd connection and here

327
00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.639
ground connection

328
00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:34.240
and then you take output here this is

329
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.839
your node output y

330
00:14:35.839 --> 00:14:39.839
this is your a b whole bar

331
00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:42.800
okay so so that architecture if you talk

332
00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.160
about the architecture

333
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.800
if this is complete just to observe the

334
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.480
pull up network and pull down network

335
00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.959
what is your connection type

336
00:14:50.959 --> 00:14:54.000
and what is the what is the

337
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.839
connection maybe series or maybe

338
00:14:56.839 --> 00:14:58.399
parallel

339
00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:02.240
okay so now how to verify this circuit

340
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:02.720
is

341
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.760
like an and gate

342
00:15:07.199 --> 00:15:09.279
okay so now we take example if suppose

343
00:15:09.279 --> 00:15:10.800
that this is one this is one

344
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.839
my output is zero

345
00:15:15.199 --> 00:15:18.320
okay so now we put a is one b is one a

346
00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:18.880
is one

347
00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:22.240
b is one both are one one

348
00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.040
so upside if you talk about this side

349
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.639
this transistor

350
00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:29.680
if the input logic is one the mass is

351
00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.959
off this transistor is off

352
00:15:32.959 --> 00:15:36.079
and this is also off

353
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.839
but in case of nmos logic this is nmas

354
00:15:41.839 --> 00:15:46.800
this is on and this is also on

355
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.079
so it is the meaning that this

356
00:15:50.079 --> 00:15:51.600
connection is open

357
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.600
this connection is open this is open

358
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.839
connection

359
00:15:55.839 --> 00:15:59.120
the transistor is off the pmos is on

360
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.320
but your nmos is actually working

361
00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.320
so what is the meaning here if nmos is

362
00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.680
actually work

363
00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.959
or nmos is on so here

364
00:16:08.959 --> 00:16:12.000
this this is your output node

365
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.320
so now here some capital return is there

366
00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.920
if suppose that capacitor is fully

367
00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.639
charged

368
00:16:16.639 --> 00:16:18.880
or your higher voltage is available

369
00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.320
maybe one

370
00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.399
so this is the ground so now connection

371
00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:25.759
is available here this connection

372
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.639
so the meaning is that your output node

373
00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:29.279
voltage

374
00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:32.560
is fall down your output node

375
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.880
no node voltage is fall down because

376
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:35.759
here

377
00:16:35.759 --> 00:16:37.920
this is a ground connection and this is

378
00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.680
a one this is a higher level

379
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.720
so this voltage is again fall down

380
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:46.000
now in this case if it is fall down

381
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.399
your output voltage is zero

382
00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:53.360
output voltage is zero

383
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.480
okay so now we take one more case if

384
00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.199
suppose that i take one more case

385
00:16:59.199 --> 00:17:01.040
then you have to better understanding

386
00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.199
what is the operation or functionality

387
00:17:03.199 --> 00:17:04.319
of the

388
00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:07.760
nand gate so now

389
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:11.839
in this case i put 1 is 1 and b is 0

390
00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:15.439
so now we put a is 1 b 0

391
00:17:15.439 --> 00:17:19.280
is 1 b 0

392
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.400
now you decide first what is

393
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.160
the behavior of the mass transistor

394
00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.360
maybe on or maybe

395
00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.320
so if it is 0 if it is zero this

396
00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.960
transistor is on

397
00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.240
i think it is clear transistor is on

398
00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.799
this is off

399
00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.240
okay now you check this transistor this

400
00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.039
one is

401
00:17:47.039 --> 00:17:50.240
gate input is one this is on and this is

402
00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.480
off

403
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.000
so now this path is not stabilized this

404
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.120
path is not connected anywhere

405
00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.120
because this transistor is open so here

406
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.480
this wire is open

407
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.240
so it is good but here if you observe

408
00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.559
this transistor is on

409
00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:15.600
so in this case your output your this is

410
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.440
your output

411
00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:21.120
okay just type okay just i discuss

412
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.840
clearly this is your output and this

413
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:24.799
tiny star is

414
00:18:24.799 --> 00:18:29.760
done so now connection is available here

415
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.000
in this case your output this supply

416
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.919
voltage is one

417
00:18:33.919 --> 00:18:38.080
your output is always also one

418
00:18:38.559 --> 00:18:41.840
your output is also one so this is the

419
00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:42.640
correct output

420
00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.919
and this is the behavior of the

421
00:18:45.919 --> 00:18:50.160
nand this is behavior of the nanda logic

422
00:18:50.799 --> 00:18:54.240
okay so i think it is no any problem in

423
00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.280
the designing and the functionality

424
00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.080
checking

425
00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.039
the functionality of this circuits you

426
00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:01.440
are

427
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.720
checking what are the two table of the

428
00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:08.080
nand gate the architecture

429
00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:11.360
there is no any problem in upside there

430
00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.640
is a pull-up network

431
00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.840
and in the downside the pull-down

432
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.039
the pull-up network is based on the pmos

433
00:19:19.039 --> 00:19:21.919
and pull-down network is based on the

434
00:19:21.919 --> 00:19:23.600
nmos

435
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:27.120
and in case of nmos the plus

436
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.840
the parallel and the dots sign denote

437
00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.840
the series

438
00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.919
and in case of pmos the plus sign is

439
00:19:33.919 --> 00:19:36.240
series and the dot sign is parallel

440
00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.559
then you observe carefully what are the

441
00:19:38.559 --> 00:19:40.880
given boolean expressions

442
00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.919
maybe plus or maybe dot accordingly you

443
00:19:43.919 --> 00:19:45.520
have to your synthesize

444
00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.520
or design your sigma circuits

445
00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.280
but the number of transistors must be

446
00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.200
equal

447
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.160
okay so always in a in all the pmos

448
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.120
transistor

449
00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.200
number of pmos transistor is equal to

450
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.799
number of and most dimensions

451
00:20:02.799 --> 00:20:05.679
okay so that is one way uh now we take

452
00:20:05.679 --> 00:20:07.039
one more example

453
00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:08.799
then you have a clear picture in your

454
00:20:08.799 --> 00:20:10.720
mind

455
00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.840
of the circuit designing part

456
00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:21.840
okay so suppose that

457
00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.799
okay after five or ten minutes i will

458
00:20:26.799 --> 00:20:27.840
take attendance

459
00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.919
okay if anyone not there please

460
00:20:31.919 --> 00:20:35.840
okay so now uh

461
00:20:37.039 --> 00:20:38.640
just we complete this one then we take

462
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.679
attendance okay

463
00:20:41.679 --> 00:20:43.600
because this otherwise flow is not a

464
00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.280
problem

465
00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.640
okay so now in this case

466
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.400
i design the cmos

467
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.720
star logic what is the nor you know the

468
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.240
boolean expression

469
00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.360
a plus b whole bar

470
00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.000
clear this is an available boolean

471
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.760
expression

472
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.159
so now how to first to design the

473
00:21:06.159 --> 00:21:07.120
circuits

474
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.760
so in my circuit my two part this is a

475
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.880
one part

476
00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.400
in this part we design some circuit

477
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.480
in the downside we designed some

478
00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.400
so this is a pull-up and this is a

479
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.159
pull-down

480
00:21:22.159 --> 00:21:24.320
so these two transistors is actually is

481
00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.880
a pmos

482
00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.880
and this two transistor is actually a

483
00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.880
and

484
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.559
because this is a pull up this is a pull

485
00:21:32.559 --> 00:21:34.480
down

486
00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.400
the pull up network is connected to vdd

487
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:40.159
and the pull down is connected to ground

488
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.280
so so it is okay it is no problem you

489
00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.559
know very well

490
00:21:44.559 --> 00:21:48.640
but we concentrate on more

491
00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.559
for architect what is what is

492
00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:51.919
architecture

493
00:21:51.919 --> 00:21:55.600
configuration here

494
00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:59.840
so first we concentrate on the

495
00:21:59.919 --> 00:22:02.960
pull down network so first we

496
00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.799
concentrate on our

497
00:22:04.799 --> 00:22:09.039
pull down so please remember the

498
00:22:09.039 --> 00:22:12.880
formula what is what is our formula

499
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.120
so just you observe in the given boolean

500
00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.640
expression

501
00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.799
some dot is there or some parallel some

502
00:22:18.799 --> 00:22:20.960
plus sign is there

503
00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.840
okay so now i observe here carefully

504
00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:27.520
this is a plus sign

505
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.840
in this boolean expression there is a

506
00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.480
plus sign and no dot

507
00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.320
so what is the rule here just you

508
00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.919
observe carefully in case of

509
00:22:35.919 --> 00:22:39.520
n mass the plus sign means parallel

510
00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.360
connection

511
00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:45.120
plus sign means parallel connection

512
00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:48.400
so now how many number of transistors

513
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.880
how many then you observe number of

514
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.159
inputs input is a two

515
00:22:52.159 --> 00:22:55.440
number of transistor is also 2

516
00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.720
so it's clear so if

517
00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.720
so here the rule adding to this is a

518
00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.159
plus sign plus

519
00:23:02.159 --> 00:23:04.400
is a parallel connection these two

520
00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:08.240
transistors are connected in parallel

521
00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.679
clear these two transistors are

522
00:23:09.679 --> 00:23:11.919
collected in parallel so now my this

523
00:23:11.919 --> 00:23:13.600
circuit is complete

524
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.720
my this lower side my network is

525
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.440
complete

526
00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.720
there is no any issue

527
00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:22.960
okay so now we go for the top side

528
00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.559
design this side is the design some

529
00:23:24.559 --> 00:23:25.360
circuit

530
00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.559
on the upside

531
00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.640
okay so this is the pull up network

532
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.840
so so so this is a pull up network so

533
00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.200
pull-up network

534
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.679
is designed by pmos actually this is a

535
00:23:39.679 --> 00:23:40.320
pmos

536
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.760
here this is a pmos is a bubble

537
00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.080
bubble

538
00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.840
so now we decide the configuration of

539
00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.279
the pmos

540
00:23:51.279 --> 00:23:54.640
what is the type maybe siri

541
00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:58.960
so according to the rule

542
00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.600
the pmos transistor the plus sign the

543
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.159
series

544
00:24:02.159 --> 00:24:05.039
and the dot sign represent the parallel

545
00:24:05.039 --> 00:24:06.320
connector

546
00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.240
that's that is a rule already this is a

547
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.919
rule already there

548
00:24:09.919 --> 00:24:11.919
so now we go for the boolean expression

549
00:24:11.919 --> 00:24:13.440
this is the plus sign

550
00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.039
so what is the plus sign plus is a

551
00:24:15.039 --> 00:24:17.279
series

552
00:24:17.279 --> 00:24:20.640
so that means these two transistors

553
00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.760
these two transistors

554
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.120
okay so these two transistors

555
00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.320
are connected in series because this is

556
00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:32.559
a

557
00:24:32.559 --> 00:24:37.440
pmos the rule is plus sign denote this

558
00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.880
so that's why these two transistors are

559
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.840
connected in series

560
00:24:41.919 --> 00:24:45.120
so now my designing part is complete

561
00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:49.039
the question complete so

562
00:24:49.039 --> 00:24:52.159
that is the one now we verify my circuit

563
00:24:52.159 --> 00:24:52.480
is

564
00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.600
actually uh working on the correct way

565
00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.240
or not

566
00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:01.279
by all the logics whatever the logics

567
00:25:01.279 --> 00:25:04.559
of nor logic are correct or not so that

568
00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:05.760
is very simple

569
00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.760
take one case suppose that my input is 1

570
00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.000
1

571
00:25:10.799 --> 00:25:12.799
now we check what is the output here

572
00:25:12.799 --> 00:25:15.919
this is a known output y

573
00:25:15.919 --> 00:25:18.159
okay so now we fix this is one this one

574
00:25:18.159 --> 00:25:21.200
this is one this is one

575
00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:29.840
clear so

576
00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:35.120
so if a and b both input is one

577
00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.960
if a and b both input is one

578
00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:43.840
then you are you just

579
00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.240
conclude that what is the behavior of

580
00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.480
the what is the switch what this is on

581
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.279
or this is off

582
00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.360
so suppose that ah this is one

583
00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.039
so that means this is off

584
00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.640
this transistor is off and this is also

585
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.880
off

586
00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.000
and nmos is on and this is

587
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.039
als this is on

588
00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.840
so so the meaning is if these two

589
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.120
transistor is on

590
00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.679
at this time these two transistor is off

591
00:26:19.679 --> 00:26:22.720
since this is open circuit

592
00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.760
this is open circuit so here no

593
00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.600
connection is available this connection

594
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.000
is actually not available

595
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.279
this is open circuit but here

596
00:26:33.279 --> 00:26:35.200
if you observe the carefully in the

597
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.120
downside

598
00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.159
if you care observing this is this is on

599
00:26:40.159 --> 00:26:42.720
also on so now this connection is

600
00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.600
stabilized here

601
00:26:45.679 --> 00:26:48.640
that means all the output is go to the

602
00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.440
ground level

603
00:26:51.679 --> 00:26:53.600
this lower potential is available here

604
00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.919
this side if you talk about the

605
00:26:55.919 --> 00:26:57.679
uh here connection this is a ground

606
00:26:57.679 --> 00:27:00.080
connection

607
00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:03.440
in this case your output is always zero

608
00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:07.840
so now this is a zero

609
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.799
okay so that is one thing one one

610
00:27:10.799 --> 00:27:13.440
combination i take in one one

611
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.559
so now we take some other combination

612
00:27:16.559 --> 00:27:18.799
like zero zero if we take both input is

613
00:27:18.799 --> 00:27:19.470
zero 0

614
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:20.880
[Music]

615
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.520
so accordingly we have to check what is

616
00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.799
my

617
00:27:24.799 --> 00:27:28.080
what is the node output voltage so if it

618
00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.760
is 0 this is 0 this is 0 this is

619
00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.240
so anyone please tell me it is a p mass

620
00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.279
behavior if the k

621
00:27:35.279 --> 00:27:38.399
gate input is zero

622
00:27:39.039 --> 00:27:42.159
okay i think you understand my question

623
00:27:42.159 --> 00:27:44.720
in case of p mass if the gate input is

624
00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.919
zero

625
00:27:45.919 --> 00:27:49.039
what is the behavior of the pmos it is

626
00:27:49.039 --> 00:27:51.840
on or off

627
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:57.360
okay so this is on this is also on

628
00:27:57.679 --> 00:28:00.080
but this time this is all this this is

629
00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.520
off

630
00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.559
and this is also off

631
00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:07.520
so now if i in so what is the meaning

632
00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.360
here if you observe that carefully this

633
00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.120
side transition is on

634
00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:16.159
this connection is available here

635
00:28:16.159 --> 00:28:19.760
because this is on this is also on

636
00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.480
so now in this case this is a d means

637
00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.559
higher voltage like one volt

638
00:28:24.559 --> 00:28:31.840
like logic one vdd means the logic one

639
00:28:33.679 --> 00:28:38.080
okay so now if suppose that

640
00:28:38.159 --> 00:28:43.039
uh okay so the vdd is connected here

641
00:28:43.039 --> 00:28:45.039
so my logic is one in the output node

642
00:28:45.039 --> 00:28:46.480
this is a large this

643
00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.760
output always one so so this is a

644
00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:50.720
functionality my

645
00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.880
my functionality of the two table is

646
00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.880
correctly verified in in the given

647
00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.640
in the given logic circuits so that is a

648
00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.200
nor logic

649
00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.240
okay so that is a fundamental thing we

650
00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.279
discuss

651
00:29:05.279 --> 00:29:10.000
now and logic and you're not logic

652
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.480
now we go for some something complex

653
00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.279
circuit design

654
00:29:13.279 --> 00:29:15.120
if if the boolean expression is very

655
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.080
very complex

656
00:29:18.159 --> 00:29:19.840
if the boolean expression is very

657
00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:23.120
complex then

658
00:29:24.559 --> 00:29:27.919
then what is architecture okay

659
00:29:27.919 --> 00:29:30.000
the suppose that i go for this circuit

660
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.279
designing

661
00:29:31.279 --> 00:29:35.840
a bar a b plus c whole bar

662
00:29:35.919 --> 00:29:39.360
this is a complex so now we take this

663
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.679
example

664
00:29:41.679 --> 00:29:43.840
so first we just decide how many inputs

665
00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:44.799
uh first

666
00:29:44.799 --> 00:29:46.559
observe carefully how many inputs in

667
00:29:46.559 --> 00:29:48.640
this boolean expression

668
00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.520
there's only three inputs a b and c so

669
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.679
in this pull-up network

670
00:29:53.679 --> 00:29:55.600
three transistors are required and in

671
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.200
case of pull down

672
00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.480
you also require three transistors so to

673
00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.760
sixth register you required to design

674
00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.200
this

675
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:10.320
logic circuit that is a b plus c

676
00:30:10.399 --> 00:30:13.840
okay so our concept is

677
00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.720
if we go for the pull down network this

678
00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.320
is a pull down

679
00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:22.240
pull down is designed by the nmos

680
00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.840
okay so that is clear now we decide the

681
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.399
combat well decide the configuration may

682
00:30:28.399 --> 00:30:29.360
be series on

683
00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:32.559
parallel okay so now we go for the

684
00:30:32.559 --> 00:30:35.360
this so do you write the arrangement of

685
00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.240
the transistors

686
00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.840
so now what is the rule just to observe

687
00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.360
carefully

688
00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.240
plus parallel dot means series so this

689
00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:47.520
is a dot a dot b

690
00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.720
that means this a dot b is

691
00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:53.440
series connection so that means these

692
00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:56.960
two transistors are in series

693
00:30:59.039 --> 00:31:00.799
okay but now the expression is not

694
00:31:00.799 --> 00:31:02.799
complete plus c's are

695
00:31:02.799 --> 00:31:06.240
also given plus c is also given in the

696
00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.120
boolean expression

697
00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:15.039
so so now

698
00:31:16.399 --> 00:31:18.480
if we observe carefully this is y

699
00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.760
suppose that this is

700
00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:23.200
x plus c

701
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.320
what is x axis a dot b

702
00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:29.200
so x plus c what is a plus sign here

703
00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.159
plus

704
00:31:30.159 --> 00:31:33.120
so plus means parallel correction so x

705
00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.679
you have already designed here

706
00:31:35.679 --> 00:31:37.279
now you put one transistor in the

707
00:31:37.279 --> 00:31:39.679
parallel mode

708
00:31:39.679 --> 00:31:43.200
this is a parallel mode connection

709
00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.640
so if it is

710
00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.600
if you complete this circuit then your

711
00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.640
pull-down network

712
00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:54.640
complete okay so so

713
00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.120
so that is the way to design the

714
00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:01.360
pull-down network okay so now we are

715
00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.960
also complete the pull-up network

716
00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.960
otherwise my circuit architecture is not

717
00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.240
complete

718
00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:09.200
so we concentrate on this side this side

719
00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.320
this side this is a pull-up network

720
00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.480
so first we observe the boolean

721
00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.080
expression what is my boolean expression

722
00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.000
this one

723
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.919
so again i write this expression then

724
00:32:19.919 --> 00:32:22.159
you have a clear picture a dot b

725
00:32:22.159 --> 00:32:25.840
plus c whole bar

726
00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.600
okay so do you do not consider whole

727
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.880
bunch is automatically

728
00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:33.440
no problem okay so now here first is a

729
00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.440
dot b

730
00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.399
first is a dot b

731
00:32:39.679 --> 00:32:43.279
so represent a dot b dot means here

732
00:32:43.279 --> 00:32:44.640
just to observe careful dot means

733
00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.720
parallel connection

734
00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.720
so two transistors you can connect in

735
00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.120
parallel

736
00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.360
but this is a parallel connection dot b

737
00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:55.679
dot represents the parallel

738
00:32:55.679 --> 00:32:57.200
so two tangents are connected in

739
00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.120
parallel and this

740
00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.840
plus c

741
00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.039
what is the meaning in the plus c to the

742
00:33:05.039 --> 00:33:07.679
plus sign you present the series

743
00:33:07.679 --> 00:33:10.799
the plus sign represents the series that

744
00:33:10.799 --> 00:33:12.960
means

745
00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:16.640
okay suppose that this is x plus c

746
00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:20.000
so x you have already designed this is a

747
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.760
this is a parallel connection you have

748
00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:25.840
already completed

749
00:33:27.279 --> 00:33:31.919
okay now here plus sign is there

750
00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.320
what is the meaning of plus plus is a

751
00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.000
series

752
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.799
so that means you connect one transistor

753
00:33:38.799 --> 00:33:41.519
in a series manner

754
00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:43.360
you connect this transistor in a series

755
00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.679
manner

756
00:33:45.679 --> 00:33:49.360
so now this circuit is complete this

757
00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.480
pull down

758
00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.840
pull up network is also complete

759
00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.640
okay so so that is output you take

760
00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.360
output here

761
00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:03.039
okay so there is no any other issue

762
00:34:03.039 --> 00:34:05.120
so now we take one more example then you

763
00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.799
have a clear picture

764
00:34:06.799 --> 00:34:10.239
in your mind okay so now this time my

765
00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:12.159
expression is y is equal to

766
00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:15.599
a plus b c

767
00:34:15.599 --> 00:34:18.879
plus d whole bar

768
00:34:19.839 --> 00:34:22.879
plus d whole bar

769
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.320
okay now this time two plus sign and one

770
00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.000
dot sign this is a plus sign this is a

771
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.760
plus sign here and here one dot sign

772
00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:33.679
p dot c this is the one dot sign

773
00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:37.199
okay so first we

774
00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:40.399
observe carefully concentrate on pull up

775
00:34:40.399 --> 00:34:41.280
pull down network

776
00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:44.720
so pull down network is this

777
00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:48.879
okay so first we observe the dot sign bc

778
00:34:48.879 --> 00:34:53.760
b means dot sign is there not c

779
00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:58.320
okay so the dot means series

780
00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.520
dot means it so now you take two

781
00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.079
transistor in a series

782
00:35:04.079 --> 00:35:07.359
okay vc is complete

783
00:35:07.359 --> 00:35:09.280
so again here some expression is there

784
00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:12.160
bc plus d

785
00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.240
so one more transistor you connect but

786
00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:17.839
plus sign represents the parallel

787
00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:20.640
plus sign represent the parallel but

788
00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.160
here you connect the transistor in

789
00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.560
parallel

790
00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.400
okay but expression is not plus a is

791
00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.000
also there in in your boolean

792
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.359
expression so plus again represent the

793
00:35:33.359 --> 00:35:35.200
parallel

794
00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:38.960
so now you connect one more transistor

795
00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.839
so so this is a complete and complete

796
00:35:45.839 --> 00:35:48.640
design for this for this boolean

797
00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.800
expression

798
00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.520
so the opposite behavior here if you put

799
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:54.880
the series

800
00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:58.000
then in the pull-up network the parallel

801
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.240
connection if you put here series

802
00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.920
then here you put parallel connection

803
00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:09.200
so now we check suppose that here it is

804
00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.240
series

805
00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:13.839
so this is the parallel bc is a parallel

806
00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:18.160
and similarly if it is parallel now this

807
00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.240
is a series

808
00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.240
and this is also parallel now this is

809
00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.839
also series in case of

810
00:36:23.839 --> 00:36:26.560
opposite behavior in case pull up

811
00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.040
network

812
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.760
okay so this is a complete way

813
00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.960
you have to design any type of circuits

814
00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:40.240
any type of digital but your

815
00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.960
primary requirement necessary condition

816
00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.640
is

817
00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.480
boolean expression if it is available

818
00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.320
boolean expression

819
00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.640
then you decide the number of dimensions

820
00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:53.040
how many transistors

821
00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:56.240
and you have to decide the pull-up

822
00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.520
network

823
00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.240
configuration and similarly the

824
00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.040
configuration of pull-down net

825
00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.599
and then you combined the pull-up and

826
00:37:05.599 --> 00:37:06.960
pull down

827
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:10.560
in a single wire

828
00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.079
that this is the wire if you observe

829
00:37:12.079 --> 00:37:14.079
carefully if you

830
00:37:14.079 --> 00:37:16.160
and that means there's a pull up network

831
00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.119
it's a pull down

832
00:37:17.119 --> 00:37:20.000
so now you wire connected here for

833
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.960
combining purpose you combine the two

834
00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.200
two device pull up and pull down in a in

835
00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.200
in a single

836
00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.000
single um single architecture this is a

837
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.640
single arc

838
00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.320
so for the connection is if the

839
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.560
connection is common

840
00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:41.440
that is your output that is your output

841
00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:44.000
okay so here if you have carefully all

842
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.920
the concept

843
00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:49.280
but you remember this one your series

844
00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.040
and parallel connection may be something

845
00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.079
change

846
00:37:52.079 --> 00:37:56.079
table is not verified or functional

847
00:37:56.079 --> 00:37:58.320
is functionality is not verified and

848
00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.520
your circuit may be wrong

849
00:38:02.839 --> 00:38:05.839
so

850
00:38:07.599 --> 00:38:10.640
so i think it is clear if any think any

851
00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:11.280
problems

852
00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.720
in this configuration of the static cmos

853
00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.400
circuit design

854
00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:20.160
you ask anything so i given something

855
00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.560
that i given some very complex

856
00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:25.680
boolean expression then

857
00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.839
you do not worry about but because that

858
00:38:27.839 --> 00:38:28.720
you just use

859
00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.079
the concept whatever what are the

860
00:38:30.079 --> 00:38:32.160
concept i discuss here

861
00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.480
according to the concept you go for the

862
00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:36.960
any complex circuit design

863
00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:40.240
may be your n number of inputs

864
00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.839
it is possible so and for the designing

865
00:38:43.839 --> 00:38:46.400
point point of

866
00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.640
designing point of view this cmos

867
00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:49.599
circuit

868
00:38:49.599 --> 00:38:53.680
effectively to go for the high speed

869
00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:56.720
computation circuit

870
00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.839
all the c circuits are high speed

871
00:38:58.839 --> 00:39:00.000
computation

872
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.880
and the static we talk about the static

873
00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.160
power

874
00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:06.880
static power is the suppose that static

875
00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:07.359
power

876
00:39:07.359 --> 00:39:10.960
means this know any path

877
00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:14.880
in no in any time it is not possible

878
00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.200
your connection is people from bdt to

879
00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.040
ground

880
00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.760
it is not possible because sometimes

881
00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:22.240
your

882
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:28.480
this pmos is on your nmos is off

883
00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:32.480
okay sometimes your pmos is

884
00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:35.839
off and nmos is on that means

885
00:39:35.839 --> 00:39:38.880
this to voltage are not connected at any

886
00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.000
time

887
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.160
so your static power dissipation is

888
00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.839
almost

889
00:39:43.839 --> 00:39:47.520
almost zero

890
00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:52.480
okay so

891
00:39:54.079 --> 00:39:57.520
this is the one way that's why cmos

892
00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.640
technology is a lower

893
00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.560
it's a high speed computation and low

894
00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:04.960
power dissipation of the circuits

895
00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:10.400
so today is what is an and gate

896
00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.920
and what is uh our what is an angular

897
00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.520
what is a nor logic

898
00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:18.160
and what is the some complex complex

899
00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:19.839
boolean expressions how to design

900
00:40:19.839 --> 00:40:22.880
in case of cmos level

901
00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:27.839
so uh okay

902
00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.520
this time go here so this is a way to

903
00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:35.280
design any type of boolean expression

904
00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:38.720
in case of cmos circuit design

905
00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:43.200
may be your nmos based on the

906
00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:50.000
this conference will now be recorded
