00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.060
welcome to in five minutes the agenda of

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.940
this clip is to understand how to make a

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.910
two input CMOS NAND in different styles

4
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.429
we have seen in the previous clip for

5
00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.429
CMOS inverter and we also saw how an

6
00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.350
inverter can be implemented in different

7
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.779
styles of logic here we'll start with

8
00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.480
the static CMOS style first thing we saw

9
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.980
an inverter when we wanted to implement

10
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.529
a static CMOS circuit was that we need

11
00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.939
to write down the expression and the

12
00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.039
truth table and two input nor gate i'll

13
00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.590
show you how to make a static CMOS

14
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.840
circuit using the truth table but here i

15
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.329
want to teach you a shortcut trick the

16
00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.489
shorter trick is whatever expression is

17
00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.649
given to us here in this case y equal to

18
00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.260
a be the whole bar hide the bag whatever

19
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.600
is underneath the bar in this case it's

20
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.500
a and B whatever is underneath the bar

21
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.350
that is nothing but Apple down circuit

22
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.039
or a combination of n Mo's transistors

23
00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.020
which will be used to be put as a

24
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.809
pulldown network so here under the bar

25
00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.879
is nothing but a and B so my pulldown

26
00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.369
network comprises of a one transistor

27
00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.640
for one input in series with be the

28
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.770
trick here is if this is my pulldown

29
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.229
network my pull-up network will always

30
00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.350
be a complement of pulldown network

31
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.600
which means for pulldown network if I

32
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.659
have connected a and B in CDs for pull

33
00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.240
up network my a and B will be connected

34
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.610
in parallel and my pull-up is nothing

35
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.790
but my P Mo's so this is a parallel to B

36
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.650
and you have seen that the output is

37
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.200
taken from pull-up and pull-down network

38
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.939
together and this is nothing but my via

39
00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.939
if you put the truth table values for a

40
00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.610
and B you will see that it satisfies the

41
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.470
truth table and this is nothing but a

42
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.860
two input static CMOS NAND as i

43
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.930
mentioned i will show you how to make

44
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.820
the same circuit using the truth table

45
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.740
but i will show you with nor remember

46
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.110
the shortcut trick hide the bar whatever

47
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.399
is underneath the bar that's your

48
00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.710
pulldown network complementary to that

49
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.329
is your pull-up network and that

50
00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.909
completes my static CMOS type let's go

51
00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.219
ahead let's make a two input NAND gate

52
00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.650
using

53
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.080
euro n Mo's here I have shown you the

54
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.540
static CMOS NAND again for your

55
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.460
reference and this is nothing but my

56
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.550
zero style general representation we

57
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.590
know that the pulldown remains the same

58
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.540
so let's quickly draw the pull down for

59
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.210
a zero two input NAND so this is I beg

60
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.740
your pardon it's not a FEMA's it's an N

61
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.620
Mo's so this is my input a same like

62
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.010
static CMOS input be rounded the pull-up

63
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.590
will not be like static CMOS it will be

64
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.620
replaced by a single p MOS transistor so

65
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.690
let's quickly draw that single p MOS

66
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.420
with its Kate grounded the gate is

67
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.700
grounded and the output is taken between

68
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.850
the P Mo's and the pulldown circuit so

69
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.959
this is my output V out and this is VDD

70
00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.450
so this is nothing but my two input NAND

71
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.490
gate in zero and more style again you

72
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.500
can verify the truth table let's go

73
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.600
ahead and quickly do a two input NAND

74
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.420
gate using dynamic style and dynamics

75
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.830
channel again we saw that the enfance

76
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.110
will remain same like static so let's

77
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.050
first draw the infect object of static

78
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.480
CMOS again that is transistor a in

79
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.910
series with transistor be you also saw

80
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.500
that that has to be a photo transistor

81
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.570
which is nothing but a P Mo's let's do

82
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.209
that P Mo's transistor I beg your pardon

83
00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.739
a header transistor which is nothing but

84
00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.390
a peat moss and the photo transistor

85
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.550
which is nothing but an N moss and both

86
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.980
of them needs to be shorted and given a

87
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.800
signal called as Phi this n moss will be

88
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.239
connected in series with the enfant

89
00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.310
logic and this p moss will be connected

90
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.130
to the pulldown circuit logic so this is

91
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.320
what I'm talking about and this is

92
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.080
nothing but might be out this is VDD and

93
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.959
this is ground this is nothing but my

94
00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.900
two input NAND gate in dynamic style you

95
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.330
can verify the truth table just remember

96
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.130
that whenever we are drawing a dynamic

97
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.780
style we should always represent a

98
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.030
capacitor and output in the general

99
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.380
style also that it needs to be a

100
00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.540
capacitor we need to be represented so

101
00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.250
that completes the two input NAND gate

102
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.739
in dynamic style let's quickly board and

103
00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:04.380
do

104
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.440
NAND gate in C square moss or clock CMOS

105
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.240
logic here we saw that the static

106
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.000
circuit will be replicated 4p fetes and

107
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
also for n fits with an additional two

108
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.040
transistors so let's quickly do that so

109
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.589
my pull-up will have to pee mosses for

110
00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:22.260
sure in addition to this it will be a p

111
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.850
moss which will be connected in series

112
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.100
this is nothing but this peat moss for a

113
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.380
pulldown circuit again we'll have the

114
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.320
same style what we have it for static so

115
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.290
a in series with B this is my infant

116
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.360
logic which is entirely in series with

117
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.220
another n MOS transistor which is

118
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.350
nothing but my file and this is nothing

119
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.160
but my Phi bar and this is a and B so

120
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.900
this needs to be connected in series to

121
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.950
this both my P Mo's m1 and m2 are

122
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.990
connected and in between that the output

123
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.780
would be taken so this is connected and

124
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.640
this is my out would be out and this is

125
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.650
nothing but ground again you can verify

126
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.330
it with the truth table this is nothing

127
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.150
but a C square most logic in summary we

128
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.760
drew the static to input CMOS NAND they

129
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.010
replace the pull-up network with a PMO's

130
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.600
transistor it was grounded which was

131
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.120
nothing but y0 and moss we replace the

132
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.190
grounded p MOS transistor with a header

133
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.900
transistor connected to phi and a

134
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.970
phototransistor n Mo's also connected to

135
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.490
phi and in between we substituted their

136
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.020
inmost Rajic circuitry and we got the

137
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.470
dynamic circuit and we also saw the c

138
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.450
square most erotic circuit hope your

139
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.400
followed two input NAND gate and its

140
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.620
representation in different styles stay

141
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.450
tuned for further cliffs thank you very

142
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.630
much
