00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
seamos or CMOS logic this is the logic

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.730
you see in integrated circuits and

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.340
microchips microcontrollers the C stands

4
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.460
for complimentary MOSFET CMOS is a way

5
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.059
to create logic in a microchip that's

6
00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.920
where you'll usually see it in a way

7
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.199
that takes more transistors but is even

8
00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.750
more power saving than any other method

9
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.420
the idea is for computing devices so

10
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.310
that they don't generate a ton of heat

11
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.349
because the more power you use the more

12
00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.630
heat is generated by resistors and all

13
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.460
this other stuff and it also preserves

14
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.579
battery life we would not have handheld

15
00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.700
devices without CMOS technology without

16
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.860
MOSFET technology we'd have to have

17
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.110
backpacks with giant batteries in them

18
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.660
to run our phones now you can do C Mo's

19
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.329
with discrete transistors with discrete

20
00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.100
MOSFETs you can hold in your hand but

21
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.510
there's not really much reason to

22
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.000
because it doubles the cost of

23
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.160
transistors every single place you'd use

24
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.350
a transistor in a normal logic gate now

25
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.440
you need two MOSFETs so it increases the

26
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.170
costs extraordinarily MOSFETs aren't

27
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.939
that expensive but you try to get a bag

28
00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.100
of a thousand it might still be a few

29
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.350
hundred dollars and also they'll take up

30
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.000
so much more space that you're not going

31
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.909
to make a ten thousand transistor device

32
00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.909
in a breadboard which means the actual

33
00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.650
power consumption is going to be so

34
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.180
miniscule it's not going to be a big

35
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.939
deal CMOS is seen in chips because in

36
00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.640
chips you don't have little transistors

37
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.259
and little itty-bitty wires you connect

38
00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.630
them with it's layers and you etch and

39
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.250
you put a layer down and you etch and

40
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.259
it's constructed out of the materials

41
00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.060
directly rather than separate

42
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.130
transistors so that's why it works you

43
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.439
can pack them in you know fourteen

44
00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.390
nanometers are smaller in modern

45
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.390
high-end CPUs but what is CMOS to make

46
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.240
an inverter with an NPN you have power

47
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.329
you have a resistor your output your NPN

48
00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.670
and your negative so this is your high

49
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.250
this is your low if you give it high

50
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.369
here then the NPN is open which means

51
00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.409
you've got a short to ground here so you

52
00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.840
have a low output if you have a low here

53
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.719
the NPN is closed which means this is

54
00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.758
not conducting and you have a connection

55
00:02:08.758 --> 00:02:11.280
to high out simple inverter you can do

56
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.069
this with an n-type

57
00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.590
AFET exactly the same way give it a lo

58
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.319
the gate will discharge too close and

59
00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.819
the whole thing will close there won't

60
00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.139
be any conduction and you'll get your

61
00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:23.299
high put your high here and it'll be a

62
00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.129
short to ground through it and you get

63
00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:26.870
your live out but just like before let's

64
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.659
actually draw nil there we go so you can

65
00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:31.189
just swap in a MOSFET it'll work fine

66
00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.549
but the issue here is when this is high

67
00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.680
when the MOSFET is open you're getting

68
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.750
your low output but there is a continual

69
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.480
drain remember how the bjts draw current

70
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.159
when they're on same thing here it's

71
00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:44.780
gonna draw current when it's on not

72
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.639
through the gate the gate will charge

73
00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:48.950
too high and stop and the gate current

74
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.379
will stop - a few electrons sneaking

75
00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.599
through but there is a continual drain

76
00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.579
through this resistor through the mosfet

77
00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.639
to ground in addition to whatever is

78
00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.219
going on over here this non-stop drain

79
00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.010
that's the problem that's the the power

80
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.199
drain that we want to eliminate even

81
00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:07.939
though this will function it's going to

82
00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:10.159
be too costly on our batteries so what

83
00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.000
if we do something else

84
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.340
let's throw away the resistor fun fact

85
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.500
you can actually operate MOSFETs with no

86
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.509
resistors whatsoever other than on the

87
00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:19.189
load I'll get into that in a future

88
00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:21.680
video and generally you do use resistors

89
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.599
by the way in case somebody's about to

90
00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.280
call me out I know that there are

91
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.870
resistors on the gates in many

92
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.759
circumstances but you technically don't

93
00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:30.439
need them especially in a breadboard

94
00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:31.939
situation we'll worry about that in the

95
00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:34.040
future for now let's have no resistors

96
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.739
what if I have my positive I have AP

97
00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.579
type MOSFET my output an N type MOSFET

98
00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.340
and my negative so positive is our high

99
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.590
negative is our low this is an inverter

100
00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.859
in CMOS CMOS basically doubles your

101
00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.349
transistor cost you need two MOSFETs

102
00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.479
everywhere you would use one MOSFET or

103
00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:57.049
BJT in a normal inverter NAND and X or

104
00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.569
whatever gate so this is one of many

105
00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.400
reasons why you just wouldn't bother to

106
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.949
do this in a discrete situation in

107
00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:05.569
addition to the savings not really being

108
00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.939
worth it so let's say our input is high

109
00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:10.340
so let's do high here and high here it's

110
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.409
inverter it's one input going into both

111
00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:14.539
of these well we've got high on the

112
00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:17.060
source and high on the gate so the gate

113
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.009
capacitor quote unquote the gate

114
00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.099
capacitance will discharge because

115
00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:24.620
there's no voltage across that and this

116
00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.750
MOSFET will turn off which means

117
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.760
is a floating output there's no

118
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.700
conductance but here we've got high I

119
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.890
drew the L in the wrong place you got

120
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.020
the point so we've got high on the gate

121
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.650
here low on the source so this gate will

122
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.560
charge up the n-type will open and there

123
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.420
will be a connection to negative out

124
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.850
here the drain here is closed no

125
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:47.870
connection but there will be a

126
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.120
connection to low there so we get a low

127
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.270
which is inverted so the output of this

128
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.490
pair is not floating the drain is

129
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.470
floating out of this gate but that

130
00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.510
doesn't mean anything so that's our low

131
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.260
now let's say the input is low well low

132
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.300
and low across gate to source here this

133
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.820
drain is closed nothing's going through

134
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.280
there but high to low source to gate

135
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.440
here the strain is open connected to

136
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.510
positive and we get that positive out

137
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.400
here drain is closed here but this drain

138
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.470
is open so again there's no floating on

139
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.390
the actual output going to the next

140
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.910
stage of logic the individual gate has a

141
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.520
floating dream but whether the input is

142
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.620
low or high there is a positive or

143
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.600
affirmative I should say affirmative

144
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.700
connection to high or low no matter

145
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.010
which one so we can safely connect this

146
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.479
two more MOSFETs because there's always

147
00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:36.979
going to be a connection and affirmative

148
00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.080
connection to high or low but also in

149
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.990
both cases one of these is open and one

150
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.900
of these is closed the only current

151
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.240
going out would be if there were a load

152
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.100
here and the current would be through

153
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.380
one or the other of these either out the

154
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.470
p-type or in the n-type so source to

155
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.390
drain here or drain to source there but

156
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.690
nothing through there's no constant

157
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.610
drain in order to get this to happen

158
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.830
there's double the parts costs more

159
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.800
space more wiring but lower power so

160
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.720
when you are creating your chip and

161
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.070
you're just itching the little pieces

162
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.530
out this is a great thing that's the

163
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.169
beauty of C Mo's there's no constant

164
00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:17.690
drain the gates take current when they

165
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.390
charge and discharge I suppose only when

166
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.070
they charge to a higher voltage really

167
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.570
because when they discharge they're just

168
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:24.950
dumping what was already in there so

169
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.290
they use current when they charge to a

170
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.330
higher voltage and they use current if

171
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.460
there's a load out so the next gates

172
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.169
would use current when they charge and

173
00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:35.539
such or if there's you know finally

174
00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:37.010
something being driven it'll be the

175
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.190
normal load current

176
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.410
but nothing idle when they're not

177
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.150
switching when there's no load there's

178
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:43.920
nothing and so they're super power

179
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.900
efficient and there's your inverter well

180
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.550
what about a NAND gate this is where it

181
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.860
gets tricky so we know it's double so a

182
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.770
NAND gate is two NPN transistors in

183
00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.960
series or two PNP transistors in

184
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.120
parallel plus a resistor here we're

185
00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.320
going to need because we know we need

186
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.180
double we're going to need four MOSFETs

187
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.610
two peas and two ends and they will be

188
00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.030
arranged like so the pea types will be

189
00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.060
in parallel the end types will be in

190
00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.110
series now regarding the notation you'll

191
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.870
see some places when they denote these

192
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.360
transistors in series you'll have like

193
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.280
your three lines on this one and three

194
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.080
lines on this one let me draw this a

195
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.850
little higher so what you have remember

196
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.460
this is the drain the substrate and the

197
00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.260
source and the substrate and source are

198
00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.750
tied together in discrete ones well when

199
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.160
you're doing a chip they're not tied

200
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.590
together so you'll actually take the

201
00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:37.080
source of one into the drain of the

202
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.090
other then you've got the drain of the

203
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.700
first one is getting its input and then

204
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.860
you've got the source of the last one

205
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.720
connected to your negative and the

206
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.080
substrates are all grounded as well out

207
00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.940
to this negative this is the way you'll

208
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.250
actually see it drawn the way we have it

209
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.680
hooked up with discretes is more like

210
00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.510
this so we've got our three and we've

211
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.520
got our input and then we've got our

212
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.250
output but our substrates are tied

213
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.620
together so it's like this so this is

214
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.450
what we actually have you know without

215
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.669
worrying about the body diode so this is

216
00:08:08.669 --> 00:08:10.740
kind of how you'd have it in a chip this

217
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.450
is kind of how you'd have it just

218
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.860
putting in a breadboard and I've tested

219
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.810
this this works fine you connect them

220
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.270
like this and even though the sources

221
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.190
are connected and it's not like this the

222
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.570
sources and the substrates are all

223
00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.480
connected this diagram is not the same

224
00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.040
as this diagram these are different

225
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.870
wirings but it works I did it in a

226
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:29.310
breadboard I made it a NAND gate with

227
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.250
two peas and two ends work fine so just

228
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.799
try to not get confused by this just

229
00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:36.630
look at this don't look at all the

230
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.610
little wires try to just say okay

231
00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.530
they're in series and hook them up the

232
00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.690
same way you'd hook up bjts you have

233
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.720
three pins you have a drain pan a gate

234
00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.850
pin a source pin so in series you take a

235
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:49.470
source pin connected to the next drain

236
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.120
pin that's it don't worry about the

237
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:51.870
wiring too

238
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.790
watch it'll work just fine although once

239
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.080
again you're probably not going to be

240
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.090
doing this with discrete ones but I just

241
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:58.680
wanted to show you that's why you see

242
00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.850
the wiring and that's why it's weird

243
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.160
because they're drawing it with not

244
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.050
shorted substrates but it'll work just

245
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.690
fine so what happens here this is our

246
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.450
output yes your output so this is a NAND

247
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.970
gate we call them-- and the nand is

248
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:15.420
going to output high unless all of its

249
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.060
inputs are high because and too highs is

250
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.760
a high so nan to highs is a low so if we

251
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.660
do high high on all of these what

252
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.760
happens recall that the positive is high

253
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.000
the negative is low so a high on the

254
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.400
gate of a p-type will turn it off so

255
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.550
neither of these are conducting so the

256
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.580
positive is disconnected but a high

257
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.890
turns on and end types of both of these

258
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.260
are open so we've got negative this is

259
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.630
open this is open going out whereas both

260
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.850
of these are closed so we have our low

261
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.790
here now if we change either of these to

262
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.850
low right now recall this is two input

263
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:55.410
I'll do this in two different colors if

264
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:58.200
you can see them to help this so on the

265
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.590
left here I'm going to say hi and on the

266
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:06.210
top is high so left P top n is input one

267
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:09.420
right P below bottom n will be low so

268
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.060
right P bottom n will be low

269
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.040
that'll be input two so what happens now

270
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.620
this is high p-type high is still closed

271
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.040
but this P is getting a low so it's open

272
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.290
so the positive is connected to to the

273
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.840
output and what happens here this n is

274
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.780
on but this n is off because this one's

275
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.700
getting a low so they're in series they

276
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.470
have to both be open for the negative to

277
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.840
connect through so this is closed off

278
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.870
the this is n technically this current

279
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.670
can get all the way through to this

280
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.650
source in between the two but it can't

281
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.110
get to this one so it's still nothing

282
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.300
happening there's no base to emitter

283
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.400
anything going on if you hook them up in

284
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.500
reverse no resistors no none of that

285
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.150
it's still effective it closed off from

286
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.100
negative so you're only getting your

287
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.200
high through the P and you can see

288
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.240
obviously if we switch it will have the

289
00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.950
same thing and if they're all low if

290
00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:01.560
input one is also low then both of these

291
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.230
are closed and both of these are open so

292
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.339
positive is coming

293
00:11:05.339 --> 00:11:07.800
both of those so once again we have the

294
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.370
situation where there is no throughput

295
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:12.990
there's no wasted current through

296
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:14.970
positive to negative other than what's

297
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.160
going up the load because there's never

298
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.230
a case where both of these are open and

299
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.999
either of these are open

300
00:11:20.999 --> 00:11:23.670
the only time both of these are open is

301
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.829
when both of these are closed so there's

302
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:28.259
no wasting and there's also no floating

303
00:11:28.259 --> 00:11:28.920
output

304
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.930
there's always an affirmative connection

305
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.399
to positive or negative

306
00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:34.230
no matter the inputs so there's your

307
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:36.779
NAND gate what about an or well the

308
00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:38.910
beautiful symmetry don't I love symmetry

309
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.160
let's put it in reverse let's take our

310
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.430
two p-type MOSFETs and put them in

311
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.910
series and then the end types these in

312
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.519
parallel so there's the output positive

313
00:11:50.519 --> 00:11:52.769
is high negative is low so let's say

314
00:11:52.769 --> 00:11:56.490
input 1 is the top P oh and the logic so

315
00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:58.620
an or gate we're doing an or gate now

316
00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:02.610
the or operation is low only if both

317
00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:05.009
inputs are low if either or both inputs

318
00:12:05.009 --> 00:12:07.230
are high the output is high so both

319
00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:09.990
inputs low equals low nor both inputs

320
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:13.379
Loic was high so if we do input 1 is low

321
00:12:13.379 --> 00:12:17.100
so top P left in is input 1 and then

322
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.459
bottom P and right n is input to both of

323
00:12:20.459 --> 00:12:22.529
those are low so what happens low will

324
00:12:22.529 --> 00:12:25.439
turn off both ends low will turn on both

325
00:12:25.439 --> 00:12:28.079
P's so the positive is getting through

326
00:12:28.079 --> 00:12:30.240
the negative is not getting through the

327
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.920
output is high so there's no waste

328
00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.290
because both of these are closed and we

329
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:35.699
have an affirmative connection to high

330
00:12:35.699 --> 00:12:37.860
if we take either of these

331
00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:40.259
let's take input to make it high input

332
00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:41.790
to is high well now we've closed off

333
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:43.709
this P so even though this P is still

334
00:12:43.709 --> 00:12:44.100
open

335
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.199
this P is closed so the whole thing is

336
00:12:46.199 --> 00:12:47.699
closed because they're in series but

337
00:12:47.699 --> 00:12:51.240
this n is open so no waste through them

338
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.250
and affirmative connection so now the

339
00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:56.250
output is low and if we have both inputs

340
00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:59.069
behind change input 1 too high now both

341
00:12:59.069 --> 00:13:00.839
of these are open so we still have a

342
00:13:00.839 --> 00:13:02.850
connection to negative but both of these

343
00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.529
are closed so we still have no

344
00:13:04.529 --> 00:13:06.569
connection to positive no passing

345
00:13:06.569 --> 00:13:08.999
through but in affirmative connection to

346
00:13:08.999 --> 00:13:11.569
low and there's your nor gate and other

347
00:13:11.569 --> 00:13:15.179
MOSFETs see most logic is created in the

348
00:13:15.179 --> 00:13:17.250
same way and there's little techniques

349
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:18.400
you can do on

350
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.200
paper to decide what arrangement you

351
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.390
need for a particular truth table but

352
00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:23.710
we'll leave that to the people making

353
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:26.410
CPUs if I ever decide to make discrete

354
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.620
MOSFET logic with seamos style I'll just

355
00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.600
create a computer program to figure it

356
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.250
out for me that's what computers are for

357
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:35.050
or anything but there you go that's the

358
00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:37.630
joy of CMOS that's why it's so power

359
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:39.940
conserving there's no wasted current the

360
00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.310
only current is during the switching and

361
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:45.940
from the load so the entire you know you

362
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.070
have a whole big chip covered with

363
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:50.890
MOSFET logic with CMOS logic so every

364
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.680
time you pulse the clock in all of the

365
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.450
things which you'll take a burst of

366
00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:56.920
current and then if you have something

367
00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.510
connected to the output pins of your

368
00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:00.730
chip that can be using current but other

369
00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.250
than that your chip will sit there and

370
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:06.130
do almost nothing there will be micro

371
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:09.220
amps or less of just trickle and that

372
00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.930
makes your battery happy so while the

373
00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:12.850
batteries dance in joy and Wonder I'll

374
00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:15.600
be seeing you
