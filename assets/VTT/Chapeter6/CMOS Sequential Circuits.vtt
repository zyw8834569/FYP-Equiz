00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.639
hello everyone so till now in this

2
00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:10.750
course we have been looking at

3
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.139
combinations of it all before how the

4
00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.299
combination circuits are we will see

5
00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.080
more all the related to movies now let's

6
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.020
look at under processes sequential

7
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.119
circuits or with a very integral part of

8
00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:26.490
anybody today

9
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:34.720
so in this do in this lecture we will

10
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.239
see how how sequential elements are used

11
00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.140
in sequence we will see two major types

12
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.409
of sequence elements latch and this lock

13
00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:46.330
you see how they are designed using

14
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:52.479
chemo we look at the delay or within the

15
00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:56.680
parameters of latch and tip of good now

16
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.600
latch insist on both have the concept of

17
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.290
naturally amended it we look into that

18
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.339
now wherever there are a sequence

19
00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.130
element there is a clock the clock comes

20
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.540
into picture so we look at the clock the

21
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.670
clock skew Oh

22
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.960
reporter it is doing analysis of the

23
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.810
glue we need touch upon time borrowing

24
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.920
and we see a bit about to face all the

25
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.950
time borrowing the delay concepts I just

26
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.230
touched upon in restricted they will be

27
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.810
explained and mean in detail we need

28
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.170
four and five that is giving citizen is

29
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.930
an analysis but here we we lay down the

30
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.240
basis of pieces let us look at what is

31
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.830
sequencing why do we need it is that it

32
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.540
now the major distance between

33
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.150
combination is equal to logic is what or

34
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.270
a combination logic we all put trained

35
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.780
output depends only on the input state

36
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.820
at that moon so if we change the input

37
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.950
after some debate in a negative of the

38
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.760
CMOS the output will respect that thing

39
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.549
for example one handed both inputs are

40
00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.799
one we offer this one if you change one

41
00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.560
input to 0 the output will go to 0 after

42
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.540
some time is amount of the

43
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.750
a sequential logic on the other hand the

44
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.359
output depends not only on the previous

45
00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.209
inputs but also not on on only on the

46
00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.579
current input think also only what the

47
00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.840
input was before

48
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.280
so this this dynasty sequential logic we

49
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.310
use to separate the previous content

50
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.599
which I mean these are the outputs of

51
00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.940
sequential elements of oil sleep or

52
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.480
tokens they are there two very famous

53
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.880
example pair or one is open of a finite

54
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.519
state machine and there is a pipeline so

55
00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.950
we go back there basic digital design

56
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.310
remember water efficient load then FSM

57
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.370
is a set of sequential circuits this is

58
00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.630
anything a particular speaker

59
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.989
now when the ecig mentions at its

60
00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.750
minimum once click over depending on

61
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.590
what input scale so a finite efficient

62
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.630
or circuit something like this we have a

63
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.920
type of lip pop bank registered and the

64
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.049
output of these registers depends on

65
00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.709
inputs and also on water what all

66
00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.010
outputs are going so it depends not only

67
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.100
on the input state with an input state

68
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.950
but also on what input was what was the

69
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.950
state of this bank of resistors was

70
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.370
previously

71
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.930
as compared to F Matheson there set it

72
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.980
like pipelining where the data we just

73
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.530
get through the Penn State is suited to

74
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.540
the state one some processing happens

75
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.810
moving this way the community state to

76
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.470
this state P and so on

77
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.660
now the question arises why do we need

78
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.090
frequent thing about

79
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.310
so let's say if the tokens or if the or

80
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.099
states of the permanent a perfect move

81
00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:20.620
at constant speeds all the parts in your

82
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.389
design then there is no need of

83
00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.280
sequencing because the sequencing is

84
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.070
inherently be taking table for example

85
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.910
in fiber optics beam light pulses which

86
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.460
are equivalent to token still send down

87
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.980
an optical cable

88
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.500
the design itself guarantees that the

89
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.630
next phase is same before the first

90
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.520
because at the end of the table it will

91
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.520
not happen with the input pulses will

92
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.630
not remove the cable out of order so

93
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.210
since this is the elta driving nature of

94
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.700
the design step there is no need of a

95
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.410
separate hardware to separate these

96
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.890
forces although will be physical

97
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.790
limitation or post by will be set up

98
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.190
like this motion is the minimum time

99
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.230
between pulses but otherwise no extra

100
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.480
hardware is the poem

101
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.820
we can say this is a equivalent of a

102
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.990
pipe an ineffective

103
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.729
in case of digital design this type of

104
00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:22.729
internal capability is not there that is

105
00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:26.210
I mean extra hardware to make sure that

106
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.110
the tokens transfer from input to output

107
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.979
right the order so what this means is

108
00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:37.490
that with the lady fast open so that we

109
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.240
are going to add a flow this is the

110
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.009
sizable including employees that we

111
00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.840
think or into our practical office and

112
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.530
there's a no course of a boot architect

113
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.780
of it feels really expensive into this

114
00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:59.030
lead the pipelining inside it or CPU

115
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.610
design so that is what will help in

116
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.880
making and the disbeliever tky

117
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.940
sequencing is required anyway as we go

118
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.000
on and see examples of utilize them you

119
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.410
start appreciating this country

120
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.819
now obviously then we use the sequential

121
00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:20.800
element like proper latch with the

122
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.710
latest pass cooking so that they move

123
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.680
with back knee one stable tighten it is

124
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.009
I someday someday lead of the show 1000

125
00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:33.910
but they have to be also possible to the

126
00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.060
Attic we have to be able to split open

127
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.240
now this compare like pick up there do

128
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.300
circuit 1 is only cut fully complies a

129
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.330
combination that is comprised of

130
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.569
combination for sequences so one of

131
00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:51.370
their combinations are sequence element

132
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.770
binding will be a bit slower than the

133
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.319
earlier one

134
00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:57.370
this site often where it is for

135
00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.220
sequencing overhead so this will also

136
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.460
call this copy because then we all

137
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.740
sequencer able to design we also have to

138
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.770
add the core but it also applies to a

139
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.520
single entity group or the eigen come to

140
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:17.259
another example theta this will be

141
00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:19.120
inevitable side effect of mentoring

142
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.280
people when you want to maintain

143
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.789
sequence you have to make sure that the

144
00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:27.159
faster tokens do not cooperate with

145
00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:30.550
local or call this is the essence of

146
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.850
speaking

147
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.060
now let's look at the two basic people

148
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:41.520
being large and at the top so latch is a

149
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.010
little sensitive device on the other

150
00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:48.030
hand clifftop is an HP building the most

151
00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:52.360
famous example of the light is ad latch

152
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.669
what the dilash means is that the data

153
00:07:54.669 --> 00:07:59.960
we are going to whenever clock is active

154
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:05.190
Christof is usually made from two

155
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.830
latches which are mine in the master

156
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.960
slave configuration we call this a dick

157
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.350
soft top or at a resistor now going back

158
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.020
to basic digital design we have each 32

159
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.770
remember the study of the chiclet i4 @e

160
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:25.320
type or registered also but in today's

161
00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.890
design world the D latch reduce the

162
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:32.799
power of the two most extensively easily

163
00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:35.188
let's look at the timing diagrams of

164
00:08:35.188 --> 00:08:39.729
latch lat collages American pipe which

165
00:08:39.729 --> 00:08:41.169
is probably on the right-hand side of

166
00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:44.499
the clock or can be the symbol F of the

167
00:08:44.499 --> 00:08:47.889
clock has a triangle attached to the

168
00:08:47.889 --> 00:08:49.989
clock rather the clock the next field

169
00:08:49.989 --> 00:08:51.579
Italian this step we should

170
00:08:51.579 --> 00:08:53.049
differentiate within a large enough

171
00:08:53.049 --> 00:08:56.410
epoch so let's look at stock usually a

172
00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:59.499
walk in a design is mostly a freerunning

173
00:08:59.499 --> 00:09:03.189
clock that you know it has a certain

174
00:09:03.189 --> 00:09:05.649
frequency and there is a hyper under the

175
00:09:05.649 --> 00:09:09.910
iPod there is a local you know whenever

176
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:13.480
clock goes high we assume data to be

177
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.980
like this we have to be changing like

178
00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.699
this what happens to sort of output of a

179
00:09:18.699 --> 00:09:24.850
lab and what happens to all okay now the

180
00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.189
last functionality is such that whenever

181
00:09:27.189 --> 00:09:29.739
the clock is active that is we are

182
00:09:29.739 --> 00:09:31.689
assuming that the clock is active within

183
00:09:31.689 --> 00:09:35.009
the hi-fi page which is doing the pulse

184
00:09:35.009 --> 00:09:39.399
now in this is a large transferring that

185
00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:42.610
means whatever happens on D will appear

186
00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:44.860
on a few of the something so we see here

187
00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.959
that D is going to fall and then we're

188
00:09:46.959 --> 00:09:48.819
going to be going to once again going to

189
00:09:48.819 --> 00:09:54.100
0 so this is this is propagated to Q

190
00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.560
so cube goes to one end to 0 after

191
00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.560
sometime now when the clock goes to zero

192
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.910
the closing edge of the table that is

193
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.000
whenever a lot is going from high to low

194
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.720
this will close the last what it means

195
00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.949
is that whatever data is Dylan Q will be

196
00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:19.389
L so any change on D during this period

197
00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:22.930
in the clock blue period does not appear

198
00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.280
on cube

199
00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.910
let's serve ice again during clock hype

200
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.430
i period given the clock - slashes

201
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.260
transparent so that we wait accommodate

202
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.840
two elegant over anything on d gets

203
00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.450
transferred on people whenever this

204
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.690
clock goes to inactive state whatever is

205
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.560
the state of teeth in handy

206
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.720
on the other hand a clip-clop

207
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.120
whenever there is a clock whenever clock

208
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.450
goes from zero to one that is viewing a

209
00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:56.270
positivity in a positive edge triggered

210
00:10:56.270 --> 00:11:00.080
flip-flop whatever is on D passes on to

211
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:00.530
you

212
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:04.940
so now as big at this moment Venus de

213
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.640
loop so Q goes down to zero the dis

214
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.010
arrow the blue arrow shows the effect we

215
00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.850
can bring logic entertaining at is

216
00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:16.310
another plug goes to one whatever is d

217
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:18.260
is transparent with you so who goes to

218
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:22.100
zero out at some point and then nothing

219
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.500
happens on Q irrespective of whatever is

220
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.490
happening on team during D during the

221
00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.830
high pass or the locum the next figure

222
00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.050
will only come as a little bit applause

223
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:36.170
when again the D is 1 so 2 goes to one

224
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:38.040
efficiently

225
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.440
the difference is the largest level

226
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.690
sensitive device that will come with an

227
00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:45.380
extra device

228
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.120
and so that are how these or to cable

229
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.920
circuits are built using theme of course

230
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.590
this is a very very basic latch nothing

231
00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:01.030
but this box is connected to grid D is d

232
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.030
NQ are connected to so convincingly

233
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:06.070
listen to go back to the bigger

234
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:07.630
thickness is nothing but a pass for my

235
00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:11.410
sister passion is to latch obviously it

236
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:13.690
is the smallest latch possible using in

237
00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:16.470
multiple modes whether the advantages of

238
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:19.930
this meat is very very small and low

239
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:22.660
o'clock low we look at what what what it

240
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.870
is men's I know clock would just note

241
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:29.260
that the clock respite has only one loop

242
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.340
that is the gate of this one is great

243
00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:36.490
these are advantages on many paths into

244
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.440
the past analytical it will have a big

245
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.750
drop it will be knowledge tooling

246
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:44.170
because oh the output is not driven by

247
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:46.480
we do it correctly or persons in fact of

248
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.760
anxiety equals back driving because

249
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:53.580
being an effective tool to the decision

250
00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.060
the effect of this is that whatever

251
00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.600
noise to use on Q can be lighter ability

252
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.370
it is dynamic they are looking to the

253
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.870
Dakotas dynamics of the dynamic manger

254
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.450
and the input is more connected to the

255
00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:11.820
inputs is not connected to this other

256
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:15.600
specific reason this is one device now

257
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.060
let's look at in next few slides we look

258
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.890
at the different movements that are

259
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:21.780
download that having done over this

260
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.630
basic design so improvement number one

261
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:27.450
we replace a power transistor biocon

262
00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.270
sufficiently

263
00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:33.860
so what we solve we solve the case of

264
00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.720
beauty drop it and now they're using

265
00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.580
both in Oakland oh so there is movie

266
00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:41.560
pizza now here note that the plot pipe

267
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.940
earlier is connected to just one gate in

268
00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.950
bookmark with the food baited hooks go

269
00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:48.190
the new road is impeding on walk and

270
00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:52.300
further it required an inverted

271
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.320
next improvement we do is that we try to

272
00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.840
we added one inverter from d2 to we can

273
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.180
add the inverter at the two sides or the

274
00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:07.250
deep end or the transition week

275
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:14.280
advantages now the in the second case in

276
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.800
this case B is now connected to the gate

277
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.310
and not to the diffusion in this case

278
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:24.150
you to God is not connected to is now

279
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.150
take it to the we frame that is it is

280
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.220
being driven by BD together it is

281
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.650
restoring Q does not drive anything back

282
00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:35.010
to gate the back to D so one of those

283
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:38.130
two these two designs fixes for example

284
00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.470
a design number one which is the output

285
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:44.160
noise sensitivity since Q is direct

286
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.970
directly driven by VDD or ground the

287
00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.460
second circuit solves the diffusion

288
00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.490
input type obviously in both these cases

289
00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:56.940
we have the output is not available that

290
00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:00.270
is available movie or put isn't notice

291
00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:02.850
right let's see one more improvement

292
00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:05.850
over this what we do okay let's go back

293
00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:06.810
to 3d circuit

294
00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:12.870
you see these three topics now

295
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:17.520
these the ex will have some the node X

296
00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.070
will have some capacitance with respect

297
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.680
to ground or wing PD depending on the

298
00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.589
logic developments let's say the clock

299
00:15:25.589 --> 00:15:28.230
is zero whenever the clock is build this

300
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:30.480
transmission gate is switched off that

301
00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.800
means B is not connected with

302
00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.110
so the voltage level on X will start

303
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:39.570
degrading over time let's say you keep

304
00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:42.690
block off course um some big amount of

305
00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:45.420
time the voltage value 1x will start

306
00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.540
degrading across the capacitance with

307
00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:53.730
the one with this is the case where we

308
00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:55.800
say that the circuit is dynamic in

309
00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.920
nature that is X the node X is dynamic

310
00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.589
emitter it may show some deepening of

311
00:16:01.589 --> 00:16:06.660
inaudible now in this circuit what we do

312
00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:10.490
is we take this feedback compute

313
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:13.310
we take the feedback compute and feed it

314
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:15.800
back into X

315
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.370
when does this happen so they can be one

316
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:22.610
one case at a time when everything is

317
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:26.380
driving this does not exist

318
00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.240
this feedback part does not exist

319
00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.640
because the connection of transmission

320
00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.760
gate is complementary so whenever clock

321
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:39.770
is one this this transmission gate is

322
00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:43.340
active this is an active if you see the

323
00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.900
clock is connected to the complement way

324
00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:50.110
so deal t drive X in the other case

325
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:55.970
where be a 40-watt so this this grid is

326
00:16:55.970 --> 00:17:00.800
off and this is optional the queue is

327
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.209
driving it so at all times X is being

328
00:17:05.209 --> 00:17:09.200
driven so that means that we try to

329
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.940
restore the value on its own organs so

330
00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.040
this circuit a static imager that means

331
00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:21.079
it is not dynamic it is fat it the bank

332
00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:24.589
driving it is negative it is die driving

333
00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:27.770
this because you will you being a head

334
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:30.740
in the circuit is dying by X but still

335
00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.860
it is and doing the working or getting

336
00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:38.150
static laughter now attention we must

337
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:41.630
make sure that the voltage levels do not

338
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:44.510
fit if the voltage levels are degraded

339
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:47.990
is very very disadvantageous that any

340
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:53.300
small noise is a becomes an idea so next

341
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.700
improvement we buffer the input

342
00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.850
muttering the input will obviously fix

343
00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:02.700
the dictation input it is an it is

344
00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.850
non-invertible

345
00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:07.620
within one more tiny improvement is that

346
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.650
what we do is instead of compared to the

347
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:14.460
PDF instead of taking to come now Q is

348
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.870
feeding back into Excel

349
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:18.960
instead of taking Q output here the next

350
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.510
control mind we take Q from X

351
00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:25.690
what does this do now is that experience

352
00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:31.690
the case of back ready so Q is Q Excel

353
00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.790
the output itself is not driving back

354
00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:36.160
anything into the circle this is very

355
00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.980
very desirable from the knowledge point

356
00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.860
of view again so this is the most widely

357
00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.740
used larger than this is very very

358
00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:48.670
robust obviously since we added about

359
00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:50.500
poor inverters with a basic function

360
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:54.070
great design with a very large it is a

361
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:59.070
slope F over here means with an output

362
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.320
it has height of the link now note here

363
00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.840
that top here goes to this goes to spot

364
00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:13.180
which opens so the loading is both go

365
00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:15.600
here just we need a notice for put

366
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.310
considering all the disadvantages also

367
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:27.310
this circuit is now this is one example

368
00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:31.510
of this loaded with less repetition

369
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:36.580
where we remove the inverter from T so

370
00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:39.970
to put it in D this can be one if we

371
00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:43.360
want we desire that between that if you

372
00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.120
can input the not problem in smaller

373
00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.950
designs or an older technology we could

374
00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:51.490
remove the uniformity and make it a bit

375
00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:56.980
small obviously in this case we do let's

376
00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.650
look at this or again going back to

377
00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:02.890
what is mono they fit into the 10 pin

378
00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:06.910
top is big moving two latches connected

379
00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:07.950
back to back together

380
00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:11.080
it's clock being inverted to D be first

381
00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.580
one this is called a mass displacement

382
00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:17.110
position so this is an example of that

383
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:22.170
so in the power circuit in this circuit

384
00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:28.980
what we do is we connect so this is a

385
00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:33.700
this is my lash this D 2 X this is the Q

386
00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.960
of first ash and this is a game

387
00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.040
this part is effectiveness

388
00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.590
they are both connected together the

389
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:45.370
thing to note here is that cloth this

390
00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:48.210
clock here and

391
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:52.920
clock here they're both our inverter so

392
00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:57.220
we burst the first latch gets a

393
00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.930
complimentary clock when compared to the

394
00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:01.990
second action now let's try to analyze

395
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:05.440
the functionality of this then we are

396
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.660
comfortable with the understanding of

397
00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.300
the functionality of the first 30 second

398
00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.890
circuit is not much different on the

399
00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:15.610
contracted whatever consumption is

400
00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:17.320
applied earlier that is how to make a

401
00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.900
robust latch we have just converted we

402
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.510
do not adhere to the more robust shown

403
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:24.790
otherwise for 10 seconds as the path is

404
00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:29.110
actually same now let's see whenever

405
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:31.000
torch is low what happens when poor

406
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.190
people or what happens when the clock is

407
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:35.010
they will lower stable home

408
00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:39.630
so then clock this stable loop table 0

409
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:43.170
that means Oh

410
00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:49.000
this our this particular transmission

411
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:56.310
gate oh so when when electric field

412
00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.790
for hit let's see the first case from D

413
00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:04.090
to X what happens from D to it so then

414
00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:09.520
PI that is cloth is you this part

415
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.160
becomes active D - D - X is connected

416
00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.460
but complementary xqq is not connected

417
00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.280
so another clock is low there is no

418
00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.010
direct connection from D to you this

419
00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:24.130
isn't our district of functionality when

420
00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:27.940
clock is 1 extra Q's connected or Cuba

421
00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:30.100
is connected and D 2 s is open it

422
00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.560
so whenever the clock is either active

423
00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:36.070
low or active voice is able T there is

424
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:38.590
no direct path from B to C now what

425
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:43.230
happens when clock goes from 0 to 1

426
00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.930
so then our club goes from zero to one

427
00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:49.020
so then when it was zero

428
00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.090
this was our active this particular part

429
00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:52.440
was not tips will be was connected to it

430
00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:56.160
so whatever is on D is on X now when it

431
00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.420
goes to one

432
00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:03.470
this latch closes and this latch starts

433
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:07.310
turning on so during the closure of this

434
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:10.760
latch whatever the value of was an ex

435
00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.520
will retain until this latch is turned

436
00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:19.430
on X stands for the 200 that is compared

437
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:20.450
with a timing diagram

438
00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:22.070
whenever clock goes from zero to one

439
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:24.590
whatever is on d appears on T which is

440
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:27.830
what happens in this case so whenever it

441
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:31.460
goes to 1 whatever is on B was

442
00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.610
transferred to X we top goes to 1 the

443
00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:37.970
value of x is a then cop goes to 1 this

444
00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:41.300
part turns on and exocomp of the key

445
00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.880
exactly same thing happens in the second

446
00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:46.340
circuit the only difference being we

447
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:49.550
added a couple of feedbacks here to

448
00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:52.940
restore the value we took the two bar

449
00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.450
form from the intermediate stage we took

450
00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:59.540
two here we made sure that there is no

451
00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:02.060
queue or two bar does not write anything

452
00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.310
back into this process so the second

453
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.260
circuit is a more robust more practical

454
00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.300
focus but to understand the

455
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:13.040
functionality the first activity now

456
00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.950
there's one more how now we we saw a

457
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:18.950
basic lack basic before what we do is we

458
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:22.160
start adding displaying pin shook the

459
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.730
table and see what happens so another

460
00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.220
more most famous Finnish clock enable on

461
00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:30.800
a date an angle P so what enable means

462
00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.550
is that whenever a label is 0 we ignore

463
00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:37.550
the clock let me know what ignoring the

464
00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:40.210
clock means we know what is will be

465
00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:42.800
there two ways of implementing enable

466
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.800
you know in a larger up to stop VI the

467
00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:46.370
MUX

468
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:49.520
so this is the month when enable is zero

469
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.090
we latch or v clock the to inversion

470
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:56.840
whenever enable in zero this drop input

471
00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.630
will get whatever is on Q so Q will

472
00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.630
maintain x value whenever enable is 1 if

473
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:04.010
there is at a normal system that is

474
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:05.870
stable we will type you wanna pop

475
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:09.020
trigger anything will last this last the

476
00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:12.530
second implementation is adding the

477
00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:16.340
gating the enable good flow so when we

478
00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:18.050
give been able to the cloth and enable

479
00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:19.790
is video this is an angle and it will be

480
00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:21.620
the clock is always be going to latch at

481
00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:23.600
a flip up to do nothing happens to the

482
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.630
path from D to build off whenever clock

483
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:29.510
is 1 it behaves like a normal action of

484
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:32.570
this pot it one advantages of a MUX

485
00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:35.210
design or let's say disadvantage for

486
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:39.050
much will so this MUX is having filling

487
00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:41.150
in the data

488
00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:45.320
so it it so in case of a large physical

489
00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:50.360
at the d2q delays increased however for

490
00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.970
a chocolate in case of the D to Cuba

491
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:55.120
remains same but for a flip-flop eight

492
00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.580
so the set-up time will increase

493
00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:02.390
quad-core enable enable will be one open

494
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:04.490
we will see what our setup voltage and

495
00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:07.400
weight of the platform lattice but just

496
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.310
remember for now that the addition of an

497
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:13.250
a between on clock will increase the set

498
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:15.170
of thing and it will imitate the clock

499
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:16.640
skew because we are adding one more gate

500
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.280
at the clock however the second

501
00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.780
implementation that is the job getting

502
00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:23.990
we will see not mood of this explore

503
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:26.750
gating is the most famous way to save

504
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:35.210
power you'll see how now we I am some

505
00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:39.860
coil head for a latch detect means that

506
00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:43.790
we want to reset the value on the output

507
00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:46.190
value we want to reset all these blocks

508
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:48.020
and all the notches in the Devon and

509
00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:51.020
what do we do so let me type something

510
00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:54.280
set reset synchronous or asynchronous

511
00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.960
means that our inside will behave

512
00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:00.380
exactly like the sense that each I can

513
00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:01.580
only affect the output

514
00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.850
whenever clock gets triggered in case of

515
00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:07.610
this system however an async mass will

516
00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:09.920
behave as an implicit whenever we assert

517
00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:13.070
reset DQ will go to 0 if this filter of

518
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:16.660
the state of the clock so

519
00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.999
let's see how do we implement a reset

520
00:27:18.999 --> 00:27:22.860
for a large and epic clock so

521
00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:26.259
synchronous case is very very simple

522
00:27:26.259 --> 00:27:29.200
since reset behaves exactly like we we

523
00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.559
just gave dv3 tip so whenever instant

524
00:27:32.559 --> 00:27:37.239
becomes 1 this node here becomes 0 and Q

525
00:27:37.239 --> 00:27:39.159
becomes 0 whenever that is transferred

526
00:27:39.159 --> 00:27:43.869
so we see that similarly for the top we

527
00:27:43.869 --> 00:27:46.179
just add reset we get it pretty that's

528
00:27:46.179 --> 00:27:46.720
it

529
00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.539
so whenever the clock trigger happens

530
00:27:48.539 --> 00:27:50.950
this node will get transferred on the

531
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:52.809
queue and the keywords become 0 Q Bar

532
00:27:52.809 --> 00:27:54.740
will become off

533
00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.080
for a sequel this case is a bit

534
00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.779
complicated more complex to a spiral

535
00:27:59.779 --> 00:28:03.220
implementation boost so we'll have to

536
00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:08.330
reset D and we will also have to reset

537
00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:11.659
the intermediate move why because we

538
00:28:11.659 --> 00:28:14.480
want to make sure that this still goes

539
00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.760
to 0 in respective of the state of the

540
00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:21.890
term and whenever the clock the large is

541
00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:24.470
transparent this also this node also

542
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:26.659
should not affect me so we add retied

543
00:28:26.659 --> 00:28:28.370
year ago when what happens and you get

544
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:31.309
both perform research goes to lunch this

545
00:28:31.309 --> 00:28:34.279
node becomes 0 and this node becomes 0

546
00:28:34.279 --> 00:28:37.370
so cube becomes 0 even then the effect

547
00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:41.360
of reset codes and the clock is 1 we

548
00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.330
need D to become one to make you one if

549
00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:46.850
let's say this node was not reset then

550
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:47.899
what would have happened is that

551
00:28:47.899 --> 00:28:50.809
whenever clock comes to this

552
00:28:50.809 --> 00:28:52.700
intermediate value it can get

553
00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.890
transferred to Q so to prevent this we

554
00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:57.640
make this node

555
00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:04.190
so to make to make sure that reset the

556
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:06.680
work properly asynchronously you have to

557
00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.590
make sure that this node here and this

558
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:11.660
node here these two nodes have to be

559
00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:14.630
reset so we are we get these two points

560
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.730
with the result same thing happens in a

561
00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:19.310
block clock cop is nothing but master

562
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:23.140
tape integration so exactly the moment

563
00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.850
there is a one more signal a very famous

564
00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:27.800
in a pulpit so now we want to make sure

565
00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.160
that queue is one should have view

566
00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.200
exactly same concept as reset only the

567
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.200
gating maintained so this design is

568
00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.590
implements both be patented you flip it

569
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:44.300
up I would urge all of you to go to

570
00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.840
slice implement this and see the

571
00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.570
functionality for yourself because this

572
00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:52.580
is an asynchronous case so you have to

573
00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:55.250
verify the functionality that whenever

574
00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:57.860
set or reset one of the set or e-theta

575
00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:00.440
deserted you goes to the correct value

576
00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.830
irrespective of the state of the clock

577
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:06.530
please note that it is invalid for both

578
00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:08.800
set and reset to be a circuit together

579
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.480
it is not a valid case since you would

580
00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.780
want the only one to happen and you can

581
00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:16.430
also verify what happens in this what

582
00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:19.000
happens for two

583
00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:24.030
okay so now we saw the designer block we

584
00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:25.920
saw the design of the latch of this

585
00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:30.390
happen now let us look at the sequencing

586
00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:34.440
method that is how are these an image

587
00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.150
connected together to make sure that

588
00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:37.200
sequencing is correct

589
00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:40.350
Plus what happens to the clock now there

590
00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:44.540
are three methods first is flip-flops

591
00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:47.880
take in clips using to fill that is

592
00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:51.140
where it is you think pilot's license

593
00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:54.120
now design also design wise that is a

594
00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:56.700
simpler in the sense of construction

595
00:30:56.700 --> 00:31:01.050
wise they are smaller but when this when

596
00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:03.930
we want to use certain amount in nine

597
00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:06.870
days I'm the sloths are much more

598
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:09.480
simpler to handle the timing

599
00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.540
relationships are much more clear the

600
00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:15.240
clock network is much more simpler and

601
00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.990
pipe adapted that is why the first

602
00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:22.320
method that is using the clocks will be

603
00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:26.340
using this this type of design is the

604
00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:30.720
most popular way or sequencing two and

605
00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:34.260
three from this force course point of

606
00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:36.380
view either the cationic lipid in naked

607
00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:40.320
D will never use compares artists or

608
00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.840
pulsated in our design in the school

609
00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:46.680
maybe maybe some of the design people

610
00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.290
maybe thumb product companies use this

611
00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:51.120
kind of design very very specific cases

612
00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:55.770
but otherwise almost almost 100% of

613
00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:58.500
Industry you will be possible so I'll

614
00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:01.110
focus a lot on birth weight compared to

615
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:06.630
method to NP now let's look at a few

616
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:09.270
things here let's look at the timing

617
00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:13.400
diagrams what all timing is insulted

618
00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:17.630
then we'll go into the sequencing so

619
00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:22.400
combination logic as only has two types

620
00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.640
of delays one is the maxilla other is

621
00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.680
the middle attracted

622
00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:30.890
how much time so the time it takes from

623
00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:34.520
input to these the output this is delay

624
00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.610
value can be of two types one is the

625
00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:38.990
propagation delay as a result and

626
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:42.650
domination when we go back we have to go

627
00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:44.840
back to vectors and see what has

628
00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:46.940
contamination today all this quickly

629
00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.280
tell the termination today is the gates

630
00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.750
where

631
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:54.960
the delay of the combinational circuits

632
00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:59.519
is less compared to the usual pips this

633
00:32:59.519 --> 00:33:01.500
is the case where the chatter to input

634
00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:03.929
NAND gate both a and B are transitioning

635
00:33:03.929 --> 00:33:08.639
so the the effect is that the output it

636
00:33:08.639 --> 00:33:11.940
gets p-value much more sooner than the

637
00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:13.730
case where only one of the less formal

638
00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:17.759
of course for this for this course what

639
00:33:17.759 --> 00:33:20.580
I would request is that

640
00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:23.230
this assumes it allows the logic

641
00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:25.240
propagation delay to be a type of a

642
00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.610
maximum that means it is the maximum

643
00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:30.270
delay this combination as it can help

644
00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:33.070
considerably ski be the contamination

645
00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:36.370
relativism to be the minimum delay that

646
00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:37.630
is it is a minimum delay this

647
00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:40.420
combination logical home apart from the

648
00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:43.840
so-called a still shot is the flip flop

649
00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:48.370
film the trigger point is the cloth so

650
00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:49.840
that the propagation delay of the

651
00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:53.530
flip-flop is calculated from whenever

652
00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:55.930
the clock rises whenever the queue gets

653
00:33:55.930 --> 00:34:02.110
affected so for the flip clock the delay

654
00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:04.360
reference point is always a clock so

655
00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:06.660
this

656
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:11.089
you have a flop propagation delay talk

657
00:34:11.089 --> 00:34:13.190
to you when you have so this is max

658
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:14.929
delay again and you have crossed

659
00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:16.219
equipment a Malaysian generated

660
00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:19.668
bilingual for latch apart from the clock

661
00:34:19.668 --> 00:34:22.699
affecting to the data also affects you

662
00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:24.530
whenever that is transparent so you have

663
00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:27.290
four types of delays to our same as

664
00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:29.629
flops that is clock the blue propagation

665
00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:31.940
is occupant and anything apart from

666
00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:33.829
there they are two extra days which are

667
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:35.480
due to Q propagation and d2 to

668
00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.799
contamination we see

669
00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:44.989
so but the AUSA lodges have few

670
00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:47.540
extraordinary values these are not

671
00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:50.570
exactly laser restriction so a flop

672
00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:54.760
let's say a cloth is guaranteed to work

673
00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:59.240
only if data does not change in a window

674
00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.970
around this log so let's say the clock

675
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:05.600
transitions here so there is a window on

676
00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.970
both sides

677
00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:12.230
during which detects emerging Oh Polly

678
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:14.869
then it is guaranteed that you will get

679
00:35:14.869 --> 00:35:17.510
a degree so this window is called as a

680
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:20.060
double window

681
00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:24.890
data should be stable at least some time

682
00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:29.570
before the package this minimum time

683
00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:33.400
constraint is called set a time that is

684
00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:38.570
data should be set up before the clock

685
00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:40.220
period before the clock breakage come

686
00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:43.340
and this restrictive time is called at a

687
00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:46.820
time similarly they should be held for

688
00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:49.090
some time after the clock and his pals

689
00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:53.470
this is session is called the whole time

690
00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:57.290
so for a pace of a block the whole time

691
00:35:57.290 --> 00:36:00.070
and set of time are calculated from the

692
00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:02.870
the the trigger edge that is the clock

693
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:05.810
edge that triggers viewing for large it

694
00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:08.540
is always a closing you that means the

695
00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:13.370
edge that closes is that latches d2q the

696
00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:16.340
D has to meet a setup and a hold window

697
00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:21.350
from that edge so a combinational logic

698
00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:22.610
does not have such a template

699
00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:24.470
combination logic is purely a technical

700
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:27.560
tip whatever happens on input appears

701
00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:30.080
sometimes a fun time offset on the album

702
00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:33.320
for a sequential element however the

703
00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:36.200
input should be stable before they

704
00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:39.680
trigger it for a clip-clop it's always d

705
00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.930
for a positive edge triggered fill top

706
00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:45.260
it is always a clock positive edge

707
00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.720
for a label sensitive latch that means

708
00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.450
which is transparent and high edge it is

709
00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:55.310
always a negative now let's see how do

710
00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:58.730
we use these these figures these these

711
00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:02.170
delay numbers these deliverables to

712
00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:06.619
estimate the frequency of a design or in

713
00:37:06.619 --> 00:37:08.750
other words to see what is what will be

714
00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:11.380
the sequencing over

715
00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:13.330
now let's look at the slip off this the

716
00:37:13.330 --> 00:37:17.560
maxilla now this type of diagram and

717
00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.630
these equations you'll encounter a lot

718
00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:22.930
of times in the next next units because

719
00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:26.740
this is the basis of calculating the

720
00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:28.840
frequency by design

721
00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:30.820
now let's say there were there was no

722
00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:33.100
sequence irrelevant here so this

723
00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:35.170
combination logic is the only thing

724
00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:37.600
present here to the delay we say that

725
00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:38.920
the delay of this combination was it

726
00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:42.730
let's call it let's call it call it PPD

727
00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:48.090
so without any so this without any

728
00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:50.800
sequential elements present the delay

729
00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:54.910
would have been TBD right now we are we

730
00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:57.040
are added one stop here man puppet

731
00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.930
we added some sequential elements now

732
00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:00.700
what happens

733
00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:04.940
so whenever let's say we frequency that

734
00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:07.190
the time period of box TV weekly the

735
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:08.840
time between the first I will be

736
00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:11.390
cognizable now everything should happen

737
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:14.360
within this period everything should

738
00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:17.170
happen within this Vedic

739
00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:22.260
so now now let's say whenever the clocks

740
00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:26.040
where this comes it takes some time that

741
00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:27.720
is the since we are talking about

742
00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.690
maxilla you will take all the math

743
00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:32.460
delays in the previous small the match

744
00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:34.260
delays are always the propagation delay

745
00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:36.630
the mingle in the end contamination is

746
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:39.630
so calm and collected we wish for the

747
00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:42.329
maximum delay this block will have is P

748
00:38:42.329 --> 00:38:46.109
P P Q so after let's say clock arrives

749
00:38:46.109 --> 00:38:51.329
on zero time t1 changes at TPC pd-2

750
00:38:51.329 --> 00:38:55.220
changes to add P P D plus TP c2 and

751
00:38:55.220 --> 00:39:00.780
since this this change here at d2 should

752
00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:04.050
be at least the whole set of Pioneer

753
00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:07.470
so what I would say is that the total

754
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:14.490
delay of this circuit is EP c q+ TPD

755
00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:19.440
let's t setup and this total delay

756
00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.570
should obviously be d less than their

757
00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:25.710
the time period of the clock this

758
00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:28.140
condition will make sure that your

759
00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:32.340
circuit work now let's see what the

760
00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:36.840
equation is so take take T set the plus

761
00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:39.360
T PC to be decidin and confirm that

762
00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.520
whatever we went as fit is inside this

763
00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.850
equation with T set up plus TP C cube

764
00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:48.420
with epd all these three combined

765
00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.970
together should be less than people now

766
00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:53.400
TPD was the original combination or the

767
00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.470
villain should we say that we realize

768
00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:59.610
the equation and take P set up and T PC

769
00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:03.480
to to this time now we see that the T

770
00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:07.800
feeding will added these two the three

771
00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.590
set up and T PC tube are only there

772
00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:12.870
because we are in sequential elements

773
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:16.770
therefore F is purple so they say that

774
00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:18.780
we are adding a sequencing over Parador

775
00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:21.480
T set up this TB see this equation is

776
00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.820
very very important we will revisit this

777
00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:26.250
many many times we'll revisit this when

778
00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:27.780
we start synthesis in static timing

779
00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:29.970
analysis so please take some time in

780
00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:33.780
understanding this or even if it is not

781
00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:37.200
clear here I am sure that it will be

782
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:41.130
clear in unit puddin pie now let's look

783
00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:43.950
at what happens when during through page

784
00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:45.630
that is I'll not spend too much time

785
00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:48.900
here on this last case intuitive model

786
00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:51.540
this is the critical case so what you

787
00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:54.180
could do is you could go back and write

788
00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:55.830
the equations on paper and then the time

789
00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:58.800
house books so the two phases are is

790
00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.510
that is the contact is something like

791
00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:06.200
this the clock of large one and large -

792
00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:10.290
so you have large one and lastly a

793
00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:14.160
connected by simple latch to two

794
00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:17.220
is does not overlap the light one

795
00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:20.670
o'clock so they are too perfect if you

796
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:25.500
have pi-1 and pi2 now what happens now

797
00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:29.250
let's say i1 goes after so l1 becomes

798
00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:32.250
transparent the data at q1 changes after

799
00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:36.810
PDQ this PDQ data is d 2 to n disaster

800
00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:42.570
TPD one now large to again latch 2

801
00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:47.400
becomes active here so this TPD - again

802
00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:50.910
/ - - and again you have CCPD - of this

803
00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:54.180
combination legacy so data after DB they

804
00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:59.210
died d3 changes after equally one less

805
00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:03.090
PPD t 1 plus t pd 1 plus t p DQ 2 plus

806
00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:06.480
TP degree without the latches the delay

807
00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.690
would have been PPD 1 plus t VD 2 so

808
00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:13.230
whatever we add here but so what is

809
00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:15.900
extra here nothing but the propagation

810
00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.450
delay of natural large group in fact

811
00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:19.860
this is the sequencing overhead with

812
00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:23.850
this group we add two times do delay up

813
00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:24.930
or latch

814
00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:27.450
now please note here that there is no

815
00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:31.020
set of times incentive why because the

816
00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:33.840
set-up time for the latch is calculated

817
00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.360
from the closing is there this closing

818
00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:39.540
edge is not important at all by again

819
00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:44.120
because we made five and pipe is no no

820
00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:47.910
we are make sure that the data d2

821
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:53.470
changes before pi/2 opens

822
00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:56.890
so we are not changing data on the only

823
00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:58.750
clothing it so there is no point of

824
00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:00.280
there is no conceptus at that point you

825
00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:03.910
in this in that case right so let's go

826
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:06.610
to again this type of design is very

827
00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:09.430
very they're using on the notches this

828
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:12.280
graphs are multiplied since sequencing

829
00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:15.280
is much more in control there as you see

830
00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:18.520
that we use two blocks here and in a big

831
00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:23.380
design that say how design has a hundred

832
00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:25.840
thousand sequential element one hundred

833
00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:27.520
thousand and sequential element each of

834
00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.470
that says either by a single clock this

835
00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:30.970
is a very very common place where a

836
00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:33.340
single clogged pipes on thousands of

837
00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:35.380
clocks in its time

838
00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:37.900
so there is a lot of clock overhead now

839
00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:41.230
compared this to let a flip-flop will

840
00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:42.730
have the power based design you'll just

841
00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:44.830
have one cup so one clock goes till it's

842
00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:46.900
in multiple housing forms if you replace

843
00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:49.600
that by latches and this scheme will

844
00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.760
have to make we have to have two clocks

845
00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:56.020
so adding one more cloth adds again

846
00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:59.290
multiple thousand over it right yes you

847
00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:01.870
have to make sure too that PI 2 and PI 1

848
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:03.550
oh no no non overlapping and that is not

849
00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:07.090
very easy being able to go into like

850
00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:08.980
cloth goes to so many buffers there is

851
00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:10.750
all of you so it is not easy to make

852
00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:13.360
sure that Phi 2 and 5 and all always non

853
00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:16.300
overlapping this is why this this scheme

854
00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:18.100
is not very very popular I put a big

855
00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:22.840
label now this is the third case which

856
00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:25.930
is a pump that is so then just note that

857
00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:28.270
we are looking at the Magdala capable so

858
00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:30.940
all we are looking at is the propagation

859
00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:34.750
delays and not the contamination let's

860
00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:37.360
look at well that is again we have two

861
00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:39.010
pulses here so there will be a pulse

862
00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:41.650
here and there will be a pulse here so

863
00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:43.540
there are two cases the pulse rate is

864
00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:45.580
greater than the set of time or pulse is

865
00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:46.660
less than the set-up time

866
00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:48.640
now here the closing edge becomes

867
00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:50.530
important because this clothing is

868
00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:52.690
becomes important because it's not it's

869
00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:57.310
just a pulse so now let's say the pulse

870
00:44:57.310 --> 00:45:00.880
width is more than a set of time so you

871
00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:05.650
will have D 2 2 we have T PDQ it is rock

872
00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:08.560
with you so you get a 2 Q plus you have

873
00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:11.740
the CPD and this should be this should

874
00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:14.830
be before happen before the EP and the

875
00:45:14.830 --> 00:45:17.850
next edge is the next pulse happens so

876
00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:20.470
combine these two cases if we say that B

877
00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:23.100
we can times the sequencing overhead is

878
00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:29.200
maxed of these PD or TT sequel that is

879
00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:30.670
either contamination of the propagation

880
00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:35.350
delay plus T set up the set a time of

881
00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:37.480
this comes into picture the closing is

882
00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:40.720
constant the picture is and - the pulse

883
00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:43.120
width of 1 because here the pulse width

884
00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:45.970
is this pulse width whispers which is

885
00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:48.160
actually eating into the siphon angle so

886
00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.030
everything should happen

887
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:50.680
for that I don't worry too much about

888
00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:52.120
the pulse status page that will be

889
00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:54.580
rarely use it will you'll never see this

890
00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:58.540
name obtained before now let's let's

891
00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:01.090
look at or the min delay that is what

892
00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:01.990
happens

893
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:05.230
so when after also off clock has an

894
00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:07.030
accidental vindaloo these are the

895
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:10.780
maxilla it is we stop let's go back to

896
00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:16.420
the Immaculate Delano let's spend some

897
00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:18.630
time here

898
00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:25.190
so let's look at this equation here this

899
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:27.430
equation

900
00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:31.380
or what what this does is equation

901
00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:34.590
valuing it places a maximum timing

902
00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:39.090
campaign on this oil design this so what

903
00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:41.970
it say is here is that

904
00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:44.849
the combination the addition of the

905
00:46:44.849 --> 00:46:47.160
propagation delay of the block plus the

906
00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:49.020
combination of it there is a set of time

907
00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:52.200
at a time is kind of able to delay in

908
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:55.980
this case this can not be greater than

909
00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:59.720
the period or the frequency of the block

910
00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:04.260
what it means is that that the Yerba

911
00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:06.789
combination logic

912
00:47:06.789 --> 00:47:08.739
and plus you have some delay of the

913
00:47:08.739 --> 00:47:13.029
clock what this does is it replaces the

914
00:47:13.029 --> 00:47:16.179
design it tells us that there is a

915
00:47:16.179 --> 00:47:17.949
natural sequence e at which I design

916
00:47:17.949 --> 00:47:18.609
benefit

917
00:47:18.609 --> 00:47:21.489
you cannot decrease TC without any

918
00:47:21.489 --> 00:47:24.400
limits the maximum limit of TC the

919
00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:26.109
maximum frequency at which you can

920
00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:31.689
operate or design is 1 / T P D + P set

921
00:47:31.689 --> 00:47:35.079
up plus T 2 T so we call this as a match

922
00:47:35.079 --> 00:47:38.349
silicate then it applies a maximum

923
00:47:38.349 --> 00:47:43.329
constraint on your frequency now keeping

924
00:47:43.329 --> 00:47:46.520
that in mind that look at the middle

925
00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:51.020
now the minimal delay of a block now in

926
00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:53.960
this case we take TC 2 so the Q 1

927
00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:58.900
changes after T C 2 D 2 changes after

928
00:47:59.329 --> 00:48:01.250
the minimum delay of combination of

929
00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:04.059
kinetic which is the TCD in this case

930
00:48:04.059 --> 00:48:09.490
now a CD plus TC q should be such that

931
00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:12.349
they do so this cloth is actually the

932
00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:15.950
figure of people typical F to the delay

933
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:20.359
change at d2 should have famous as I it

934
00:48:20.359 --> 00:48:22.190
means the whole time requirement of this

935
00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:27.430
form so you have

936
00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:34.210
so what it means is that they say cube

937
00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:36.370
the facility should be better than the

938
00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:41.170
evil data should be held kept held after

939
00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:44.530
T hold when does it a day since they

940
00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:46.930
doesn't exactly see decontamination

941
00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:49.090
denier the flop less GCD of the

942
00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:52.420
combination on it so theta D plus T city

943
00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:53.770
pool could be greater than two holes

944
00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:57.130
which is a quick hint we arrays an equal

945
00:48:57.130 --> 00:48:59.670
equation

946
00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.990
and come up with this so TC did the

947
00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:05.270
species DQ is greater than P who is

948
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:07.579
greater than or equal to these people we

949
00:49:07.579 --> 00:49:09.069
rearrange the equation and get this

950
00:49:09.069 --> 00:49:14.930
again the sequencing overhead is nothing

951
00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:17.660
but this TC - it is actually not a

952
00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:19.790
sequencing overhead but what it does it

953
00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:21.500
places a min timing requirement only

954
00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:23.809
only totally so what is the total delay

955
00:49:23.809 --> 00:49:26.180
here the total delay is TC d + T to

956
00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:30.079
people and it should as every time all

957
00:49:30.079 --> 00:49:31.760
other times it should be greater than

958
00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:35.390
the T whole so now we see that the total

959
00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:38.839
delayed that is the delay is actually

960
00:49:38.839 --> 00:49:40.339
nothing but the combination delay

961
00:49:40.339 --> 00:49:44.510
position constantly should be at all

962
00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:49.369
times greater than the table or and less

963
00:49:49.369 --> 00:49:53.630
than the time period of the clock a

964
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:56.150
destroyed by the set of thing so in fact

965
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:58.579
now the delay of the circuit is limited

966
00:49:58.579 --> 00:50:00.260
by two gate which is one is the max

967
00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:03.230
whether there is the mill you also know

968
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:05.720
that there is no the clock frequency

969
00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:08.630
does not come into picked in here we go

970
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:11.990
into depth in in in unit five on this

971
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:13.250
equation this equation is very very

972
00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:14.839
important again a mass at a time

973
00:50:14.839 --> 00:50:17.230
occlusion

974
00:50:20.289 --> 00:50:22.940
similarly we have the amended a case for

975
00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:26.539
two-phase watches and we have the Middle

976
00:50:26.539 --> 00:50:29.089
Ages for the pulp so there is an

977
00:50:29.089 --> 00:50:31.490
indelicate of people that is again it's

978
00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:33.710
very slow to the earlier case where we

979
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:39.020
say that the V delay here PT d 1 t CD

980
00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:44.150
with the CDP and plus TC c q+ be non

981
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:46.250
over plus should be greater than the t1

982
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:52.880
requirement the paradox here is that the

983
00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:56.109
volt time is reduced by the non overlap

984
00:50:56.109 --> 00:51:01.270
the whole time applies to IC cycle but

985
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:04.609
only once for flops but again inside

986
00:51:04.609 --> 00:51:06.049
this block is made up of two lightest

987
00:51:06.049 --> 00:51:08.990
you can verify this no need to go deep

988
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:10.970
into the salad of it might be bit

989
00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:13.520
confusing but we be clear that the one

990
00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:15.859
thing is clear that the equation of

991
00:51:15.859 --> 00:51:18.049
clocks are similar the template compared

992
00:51:18.049 --> 00:51:20.450
to that it's the crossing me modulations

993
00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:23.900
left you have known this disadvantage we

994
00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:26.059
don't have to worry about overlapping

995
00:51:26.059 --> 00:51:29.990
Natomas cross so that is why of clips

996
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:32.650
off base design

997
00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:37.790
this is a case of pulse gadgets of a lot

998
00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:41.150
void in code peep into it or there is no

999
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:43.900
no need for it now

1000
00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:47.120
now let's touch upon it and search by

1001
00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:51.940
time bottom now in a cloud-based system

1002
00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:57.170
the data a imagine imagine a design like

1003
00:51:57.170 --> 00:51:59.350
this

1004
00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:04.140
let's go back to face

1005
00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:08.730
so a design like this they play

1006
00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:12.840
knowledge on to the rising finish from

1007
00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:14.910
the power one

1008
00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:18.930
engage staff third d2 gets captured at

1009
00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:21.809
an f2 on this edge

1010
00:52:21.809 --> 00:52:24.709
this place is constrained here that

1011
00:52:24.709 --> 00:52:27.119
everything that has to happen has to

1012
00:52:27.119 --> 00:52:30.410
happen between these waited

1013
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:38.660
so so data bounces on one rising edge

1014
00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:41.300
must set up that is it should become

1015
00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:44.480
stable the poor set of time before the

1016
00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:47.600
next rising it is this the data arise

1017
00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:49.970
dead system field of the sleep you need

1018
00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:51.770
is to capture the new meta but it is

1019
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:54.590
rail you could not capture it if it

1020
00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:58.310
arrives early that means if it arrives

1021
00:52:58.310 --> 00:53:00.920
feel it earlier then the whole time

1022
00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:04.340
requirement of the next stop then again

1023
00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:06.690
the system pain

1024
00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:08.940
of call second case with a knife

1025
00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:10.410
somewhere in the menu button it means

1026
00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:12.599
owns the whole time with Hammond and the

1027
00:53:12.599 --> 00:53:15.030
second time requirement so that that

1028
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:17.030
time you have that in any time you are

1029
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:21.390
it's actually registered it in the sense

1030
00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:25.740
that what it again tells us that these

1031
00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:28.560
past tokens you you slowed them but then

1032
00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:29.880
you had some margin available that

1033
00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:32.160
margin assistance so what is the what it

1034
00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:33.810
compares it we compared the clock based

1035
00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:36.030
system of the knife that system in Delta

1036
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:39.839
dash is a data arise early but it still

1037
00:53:39.839 --> 00:53:41.760
beats hold on retirement time invasive

1038
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:44.280
plots have harder this vendôme

1039
00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:47.190
importantly you will notice and they are

1040
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:49.650
they design that since the clock works

1041
00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:51.780
on it is nothing happens between the

1042
00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:54.150
edges in the block so God has high

1043
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:57.359
degrees now compared to this in a large

1044
00:53:57.359 --> 00:53:59.910
plate system a data can pass through

1045
00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:02.200
Latin transform

1046
00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:06.940
what it is is that by May with the clock

1047
00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:09.310
overlapping or non-overlapping of the

1048
00:54:09.310 --> 00:54:11.980
clocks we can actually make sure that

1049
00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:13.930
time is what we will the fish soil time

1050
00:54:13.930 --> 00:54:17.410
bottle but if we take the time from a

1051
00:54:17.410 --> 00:54:19.840
past present and give the time that much

1052
00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:22.400
lower subject

1053
00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:25.880
only if the only condition is that each

1054
00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:28.430
loop should complete in one cycle let's

1055
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:30.880
look at one example this is again I will

1056
00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:36.100
this is now common design feature where

1057
00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:40.850
so what happens is that your Phi 1 and

1058
00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:43.850
Phi 2 again engage now in this case Phi

1059
00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:45.590
1 and Phi 2 are complement working with

1060
00:54:45.590 --> 00:54:47.450
it so there is actually only one plus

1061
00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:51.260
Phi 1 and this complementary and it is

1062
00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:54.010
inverted and given to that in the middle

1063
00:54:54.010 --> 00:55:00.470
so this the slash launch data there will

1064
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:02.560
be this powerful combination video and

1065
00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:07.820
then we could borrow time from this

1066
00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:10.670
circuit to this sir this time

1067
00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:14.150
why because let's say this is a slow

1068
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:16.880
circuit this part is the source of it so

1069
00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:19.220
it takes a lot of time and it if the

1070
00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:21.440
data becomes stable somewhere here and

1071
00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:23.240
there here but now the light is

1072
00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:26.840
transparent so there is no inter does

1073
00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:29.530
not smoke near data directly goes to

1074
00:55:29.530 --> 00:55:33.970
this third lash and

1075
00:55:33.970 --> 00:55:37.960
and let's play this when it wants to

1076
00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:41.410
capture this today - it should remain

1077
00:55:41.410 --> 00:55:44.920
stable should come let us somewhere

1078
00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:47.050
around here even if it is circuit this

1079
00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:49.300
part of circuit is slow and it is called

1080
00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:51.910
a circuit ISM is passed we make sure

1081
00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:55.210
that the data the time is not wasted and

1082
00:55:55.210 --> 00:55:58.270
in that was spoken to utilize the only

1083
00:55:58.270 --> 00:56:00.310
requirement the only constraint here is

1084
00:56:00.310 --> 00:56:06.540
that the only constraint is that the

1085
00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:08.859
combined array of combinational logic 1

1086
00:56:08.859 --> 00:56:11.470
and combination of the two should I fall

1087
00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:15.460
cause the less than this this time

1088
00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:17.740
people this time period will again look

1089
00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:20.230
more integrated we look at a case where

1090
00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:22.119
actually this is a clock this is the

1091
00:56:22.119 --> 00:56:24.579
clock and this particle all this very

1092
00:56:24.579 --> 00:56:27.310
famous time or anything remember this

1093
00:56:27.310 --> 00:56:30.490
the more detail in uniform

1094
00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:32.730
this is a game one more example of

1095
00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:37.930
fabric minute we can do so see this this

1096
00:56:37.930 --> 00:56:40.210
length is more help or affirmation Alec

1097
00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:41.740
so this means it's a flavor bit is the

1098
00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:45.030
past body again this is B cases came at

1099
00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:48.030
spacing

1100
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:51.749
now only in all the previous examples we

1101
00:56:51.749 --> 00:56:56.609
were reviewing that clock skew see what

1102
00:56:56.609 --> 00:56:58.700
it means is that the clock arrives on

1103
00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:00.960
this clock when I need to talk to at the

1104
00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:03.769
same time but this is not exactly true

1105
00:57:03.769 --> 00:57:08.369
the clocks will block school to

1106
00:57:08.369 --> 00:57:12.119
thousands of knots in the design not all

1107
00:57:12.119 --> 00:57:13.619
the stocks will get the clock at the

1108
00:57:13.619 --> 00:57:14.220
same time

1109
00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:16.319
there will be some uncertainty in the

1110
00:57:16.319 --> 00:57:19.410
arrival time what it does run certainly

1111
00:57:19.410 --> 00:57:21.809
touch to design is that it decreases the

1112
00:57:21.809 --> 00:57:24.720
maximum population to make it increases

1113
00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:27.230
the venue's contamination billet it

1114
00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:29.759
decreases sine bothering so it X

1115
00:57:29.759 --> 00:57:32.270
negatively in all the cases

1116
00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:36.619
let's see one clip or pop the dogs so

1117
00:57:36.619 --> 00:57:40.670
what so now there's a you see this this

1118
00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:43.520
figure here and now the clock arrival at

1119
00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:46.210
each of the clip drops is actually

1120
00:57:46.210 --> 00:57:48.950
entertaining some limiting it is

1121
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:51.589
uncertain in this limit so what it does

1122
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:54.830
is what it reduces the amount of margin

1123
00:57:54.830 --> 00:57:57.770
you have so what it does is that with I

1124
00:57:57.770 --> 00:57:59.660
to the propagation delay so we saw that

1125
00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:04.160
so reading the CPC capacity hitter now

1126
00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:07.310
we act a skew with this still these

1127
00:58:07.310 --> 00:58:10.369
queue adds to the sequencing overhead

1128
00:58:10.369 --> 00:58:15.200
similarly this queue however it's shown

1129
00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:16.880
positive here but this you can also be

1130
00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:18.859
negative that means it can also affect

1131
00:58:18.859 --> 00:58:21.950
the whole time negatively so so what

1132
00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:23.060
happens let's say if the blockage

1133
00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:25.160
arrived early here it is not good

1134
00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:28.190
positive case if the if the clock edge

1135
00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:30.290
arrives later here it is not good for

1136
00:58:30.290 --> 00:58:33.970
the whole we have anything more detail

1137
00:58:33.970 --> 00:58:37.100
for n-type

1138
00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:40.800
let this a few things for lattice you

1139
00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:43.980
can go to the equation again since it's

1140
00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:45.840
not a very popular demand you can even

1141
00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:47.560
pick pick

1142
00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:49.720
so let's look at what happens it's at a

1143
00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:51.910
time and one is in such a time involved

1144
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:55.450
it means we saw that the sector time

1145
00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:58.030
poses a maximum performance they can

1146
00:58:58.030 --> 00:59:00.670
only depend so checkout time is violated

1147
00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:03.460
on a manner actually you can actually

1148
00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:05.620
reduce the frequency and when you pet

1149
00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:08.110
with the footage looking back at the

1150
00:59:08.110 --> 00:59:09.850
whole time knowledge you can do nothing

1151
00:59:09.850 --> 00:59:14.500
just will fail at any frequency this

1152
00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:16.810
whole time requirement is not the whole

1153
00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:19.360
time constrain the militant or depending

1154
00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:22.270
on sub sequences so in fact this is the

1155
00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:25.240
result will be teaching we will even buy

1156
00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:26.130
it

1157
00:59:26.130 --> 00:59:31.450
people are designers are more alert more

1158
00:59:31.450 --> 00:59:33.730
very of the whole time with this in

1159
00:59:33.730 --> 00:59:37.210
context a set of changes so you have to

1160
00:59:37.210 --> 00:59:40.950
make sure that hold minutes apologies

1161
00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:45.160
what all cases we need such all the

1162
00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:48.310
voltage will be voltage base for the

1163
00:59:48.310 --> 00:59:52.180
typical specified it means at all the

1164
00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:54.550
corners of the temperature range it

1165
00:59:54.550 --> 00:59:56.830
means in the slow process as well as

1166
00:59:56.830 --> 00:59:59.200
past purpose will be strong it available

1167
00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:04.330
so this kind of this mess that camera is

1168
01:00:04.330 --> 01:00:06.070
what we saw what we learned in the

1169
01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:11.170
liquid we saw the design for the to

1170
01:00:11.170 --> 01:00:13.120
visit people beginning will at event at

1171
01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:16.300
the pub will drop a very very easy to

1172
01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:18.240
use they are supported by all dooms

1173
01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:21.280
these all the three sequin things mean

1174
01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.210
to stop the clocks

1175
01:00:22.210 --> 01:00:23.800
who pays transfer matches and perfect

1176
01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:27.070
matches who this transfer attaches have

1177
01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:29.440
a problem of students you have to have

1178
01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:33.040
known overlapping box and my model file

1179
01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:37.000
status are I in my experience I have a

1180
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.260
new perspective over this vulgar

1181
01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:43.780
completely different launching so I form

1182
01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:45.910
this place altogether this table gives

1183
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:49.980
the sequence in overhead I'd be

1184
01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:52.120
sequencing overhead of the match today

1185
01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:53.740
the minimum volume today and the time

1186
01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:56.110
but I see so you see for the Smith knobs

1187
01:00:56.110 --> 01:00:57.250
there is no such concept that time

1188
01:00:57.250 --> 01:00:59.140
bottom-feeder

1189
01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:00.730
there are some time boiling equations

1190
01:01:00.730 --> 01:01:03.190
for two phase constant that is my static

1191
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:08.109
you conscripted so that is all for this

1192
01:01:08.109 --> 01:01:12.480
vector thank you
