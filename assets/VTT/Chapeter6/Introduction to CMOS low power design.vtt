00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.610
in this video lecture we are going to

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.589
have an introductory view on power

3
00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.250
dissipation and low power design

4
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.809
previously we have focused on circuit

5
00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.820
speed when we have considered circuit

6
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.340
performance but speed comes at a cost

7
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.820
power dissipation there is dynamic power

8
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.310
which is dissipated in circuits at work

9
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.670
and there is static power dissipated in

10
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.699
circuits at standby in this video

11
00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.619
lecture we're going to have a look at

12
00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.279
how and when power is dissipated and how

13
00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.160
have a look at some basic methods for

14
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.579
reducing power dissipation first some

15
00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.739
definitions concerning energy and power

16
00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.739
in circuit elements as you certainly

17
00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.110
know power is drawn from voltage sources

18
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.710
attached to the VDD pin of a chip in

19
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.550
form of a current idd this power is

20
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.309
dissipated in resistive elements like

21
00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.730
the MOSFETs or temporarily stored in own

22
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.180
chip capacitors coming from MOSFET gates

23
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.310
or drains and from interconnect wiring

24
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.900
instantaneous power as a function of

25
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.720
time is the product of instantaneous

26
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.780
current and voltage energy is the power

27
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.540
integrated over time the average power

28
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.150
is the energy divided by time and

29
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.670
finally energy stored in a capacitor can

30
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.340
be obtained by integrating this the

31
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.920
instantaneous power over time T until

32
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.860
the voltage across the capacitor reached

33
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.340
its final value VC so this is one-half

34
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.790
CV squared now let's have a look at the

35
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.009
dynamic power dissipation in this

36
00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.250
inverter with a switching input voltage

37
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.700
V in and an output voltage V out so

38
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.700
input voltage V in output voltage V out

39
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.430
previously our focus was on the rise and

40
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.250
fall delays but now we are shifting

41
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.720
- the currents flowing during switching

42
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.540
these currents are idd leaving the power

43
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.920
supply ISS flow into ground and I load

44
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.460
flow into the load capacitor it was

45
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.170
first considered power dissipation

46
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.960
during a rising output when the load

47
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.460
capacitor is being charged current now

48
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:51.750
flows from VDD to the capacitor from the

49
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.180
moment when the p-channel MOSFET starts

50
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.190
to conduct which is when the input

51
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.570
voltage drops below VDD plus vtp - when

52
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.330
the output voltage reaches its final

53
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.490
value during this period i DD and I load

54
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.520
are equal old current is flowing from

55
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.140
the power supply into the capacitor the

56
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.900
energy needed to charge the capacitor C

57
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.610
load to its final value VDD is equal to

58
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:30.120
C load VDD squared you see the equations

59
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.280
here the energy stored in C load is

60
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.550
equal to half of the energy needed to

61
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.180
charge the capacitor the other half of

62
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.450
the energy was dissipated as heat in the

63
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.330
P channel MOSFET let's shift focus to

64
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.030
consider power dissipation during a

65
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.580
falling output when the load capacitor

66
00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.510
is being discharged current now flows

67
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:07.530
from the capacitor to ground from the

68
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.930
moment when the N channel MOSFET starts

69
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.240
to conduct which is from when the input

70
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.738
voltage rises above VN until the output

71
00:04:16.738 --> 00:04:21.139
voltage reaches its final value

72
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.230
the energy stored in the load capacitor

73
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.110
is now being dissipated as heat in the

74
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:39.190
n-channel MOSFET while the input voltage

75
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.470
is switching between states there is a

76
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.610
certain timeframe

77
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.780
TSC during which both MOSFETs are on

78
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.240
this leads to a blip of what we somewhat

79
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.580
careless occurs a short-circuit current

80
00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.130
flowing from VDD to VSS appearing both

81
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.210
here in ID D is s both before rising and

82
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.670
falling outputs and is marginally

83
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:12.610
affecting both LED and ISS like this the

84
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.610
energy lost in short circuit can be

85
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.970
estimated from the peak short-circuit

86
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.520
current and the switching times TRC

87
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.770
leading to this expression which is

88
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.830
usually much smaller than the energy

89
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.340
needed to load to charge the load

90
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.410
capacitance it's about 10 percent of as

91
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.450
a rule of thumb of the total dynamic

92
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.150
energy if input and output rise and fall

93
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.610
times are comparable and we will

94
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.920
generally ignore this component of the

95
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.150
power dissipation dynamic power

96
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.390
dissipation in summary power is drawn

97
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.490
from the voltage source that is attached

98
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.450
to the VDD pins of a chip this power is

99
00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.640
dissipated in resistive elements like

100
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.040
the MOSFETs or temporarily stored in

101
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.490
circuit node capacitors the average

102
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.160
power dissipation is equal to the

103
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.320
average energy needed during a clock

104
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:17.590
cycle T this energy is the if circuit

105
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.320
effective capacitance times V DD squared

106
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.130
to be multiplied by the clock frequency

107
00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:28.390
to yield power the effective capacitance

108
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:33.000
is equal to the activity factor alpha

109
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.480
times C load the total circuit

110
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.050
capacitance of the circuit that is the

111
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.890
sum of all node capacitances the

112
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.870
activity factor is the sum of all

113
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.540
effective node capacitances divided by

114
00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:53.430
the total circuit capacitance C load for

115
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.920
the activity factor alpha we can say

116
00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.930
that for the clock distribution network

117
00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.240
that is charged and discharged every

118
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.110
clock cycle the activity factor is 1 for

119
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.870
the input of a logic gate going high or

120
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.080
low during a clock cycle then alpha is

121
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.240
equal to 1/2 let's have a look at an

122
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.970
example where we have a 1 billion

123
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.180
transistor and we are asked to estimate

124
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.640
the dynamic power consumption at the

125
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:28.110
switching frequency of 1 gigahertz so on

126
00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.900
this chip we have 50 million logic

127
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.480
transistors with an average which width

128
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.780
of 300 nanometers and an activity factor

129
00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.660
of 10 percent there are nine hundred and

130
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.900
fifty million memory transistors average

131
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.810
width 100 nanometer and an activity

132
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:52.140
factor of two percent we assume a 1 volt

133
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.320
65 nanometer process and the capacitance

134
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.510
is 1 femto farad per micron gate

135
00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:00.680
capacitance and point 8 FEM to farad per

136
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.900
micron diffusion capacitance from

137
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:09.740
sources and drains the total logic

138
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.290
capacitance 50 million transistors times

139
00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.630
their width times the capacitance per

140
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:20.580

141
00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.190

to farad per micron 179 2 farad's none

144
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.840
of ours the dynamic power dissipation

145
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:41.130
then is alpha logic times C logic plus

146
00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:43.799
alpha memory times C memory times the

147
00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:46.680
frequency times BD d squared

148
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:57.350
and we get six watts 6.1 what's the this

149
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.880
shows that there is a global activity

150
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.390
factor of six divided by two hundred

151
00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:10.589
three percent this is a slide that Pat

152
00:09:10.589 --> 00:09:12.959
Gelson German from Intel showed at the

153
00:09:12.959 --> 00:09:14.610
international solid-state circuits

154
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.360
conference in 2001 it shows that power

155
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.120
was not much of a concern during the 70s

156
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.810
80s or 90s but in the new millennium

157
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.180
there was a clear trend that the power

158
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.040
density on processor chips was

159
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.570
increasing rapidly CPUs were already as

160
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.490
hot as the hot plates on the kitchen

161
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:37.830
stove and was approaching that of a

162
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:41.630
nuclear reactor a trend had to be broken

163
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.580
for Intel this was the start of going

164
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.730
multi-core the race for meeting customer

165
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.529
demand will higher and high clock rate

166
00:09:49.529 --> 00:09:52.350
higher and higher clock rates was over

167
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:55.140
but also in general terms power

168
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.630
dissipation was quickly becoming a main

169
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.050
concern so what could be done to reduce

170
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:07.709
power dissipation we could of course

171
00:10:07.709 --> 00:10:10.740
lower the power supply voltage which

172
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.930
would be very effective since the power

173
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.420
is proportional to this voltage squared

174
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.770
but on the other hand power gives speed

175
00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.750
we could minimize the load capacitance

176
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:24.660
by minimizing gate capacitances fewer

177
00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.080
stages of logic and small gate sizes we

178
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.050
could minimize wire capacitance by

179
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:32.790
having good floor planning to keep

180
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:35.640
communicating blocks close to each other

181
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.120
and careful drive of long wires using

182
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.510
repeaters we can also reduce the clock

183
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:46.140
frequency but again we want speed we can

184
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.990
reduce activity factor no unnecessary

185
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.800
switching

186
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:56.460
getting the most efficient way to reduce

187
00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.590
the switching activity is to turn off

188
00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:02.000
the clock to registers in unused block

189
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.290
this saves on the clock activity which

190
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:09.420
switching activity which is one it

191
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.700
eliminates all switching activity in

192
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:15.930
clock gated blocks but it requires some

193
00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:18.720
enable logic determining if a block will

194
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.600
be used or not

195
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:26.400
so this gated clock wire is not charged

196
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.430
or discharged when the local clock is

197
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:37.620
blocked by the clock later we can also

198
00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.710
reduce the supply voltage you can do

199
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:43.830
that by running different blocks in the

200
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.320
circuit at the lowest possible voltage

201
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.300
and frequency that meets performance

202
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.150
requirements this is the so-called multi

203
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.660
VDD technology the chip is divided into

204
00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.700
different voltage domains with separate

205
00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.100
voltage supplies two different blocks as

206
00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.260
shown in this example where the cache

207
00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.500
memories run on 1.2 volts while the CPU

208
00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:10.230
runs on 1.0 volt one problem is that

209
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.810
level converters are required when

210
00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:15.390
crossing from domains with low VDD 2

211
00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:22.230
domains with higher VDD so here is the

212
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:26.390
VDD low and VDD high so we need this

213
00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:31.520
level converter in between these blocks

214
00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:40.770
the next step is to use DVS dynamic

215
00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:43.950
voltage scaling where we adjust both VDD

216
00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:48.750
and frequency according to workload this

217
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:52.290
requires a DVS controller that monitors

218
00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.589
the workload and the chip temperature

219
00:12:54.589 --> 00:12:57.450
this information is used to control the

220
00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.870
clock frequency and the supply voltage

221
00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.920
through a voltage regulator that

222
00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.860
supplies the correct VDD to the core

223
00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.010
logic

224
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.279
so far we have discussed dynamic power

225
00:13:14.279 --> 00:13:16.740
dissipation but there is also static

226
00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.620
power dissipation static power is

227
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.160
consumed even when chip is quietened

228
00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.310
leakage draws power from nominally off

229
00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:30.480
devices and this figure illustrates the

230
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.690
gate leakage drain leakage and sub

231
00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:38.310
threshold leakage Junction leakage from

232
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:39.990
reverse bias PN junctions between

233
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:43.199
diffusion and substrate is usually

234
00:13:43.199 --> 00:13:46.709
negligible but second-order leakage

235
00:13:46.709 --> 00:13:48.510
mechanisms might be important in the

236
00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:52.160
future like b2b band-to-band tunnelling

237
00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.930
Gadol the gate induced drain leakage

238
00:13:57.290 --> 00:14:00.480
when it comes to gate leakage it's an

239
00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.670
extremely strong function of the oxide

240
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:06.149
thickness and the gate voltage it was

241
00:14:06.149 --> 00:14:09.269
negligible for older processes but it

242
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:12.390
approaches sub threshold leakage at 65

243
00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:15.680
nanometer and below in some processes

244
00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.600
it's an order of magnitude less for P

245
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:24.329
Mo's than for n Mo's transistors keep

246
00:14:24.329 --> 00:14:26.519
thickness of Gaetti electric at least

247
00:14:26.519 --> 00:14:29.850
10.5 angstrom to prevent tunneling high

248
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:33.449
K gate dielectrics help some processes

249
00:14:33.449 --> 00:14:36.440
even provide multiple oxide thicknesses

250
00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.870
like for thicker oxides for the 3.3 volt

251
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:43.620
IO transistors and you can control a

252
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:50.730
kitchen circuits by limiting VDD finally

253
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.380
sub threshold leakage we're gonna have a

254
00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.910
closer look at the sub threshold leakage

255
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.100
as geometries have shrunk to 65

256
00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.160
nanometer and below libraries have

257
00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.279
started to appear with multiple VT that

258
00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:06.959
has become a common way of reducing

259
00:15:06.959 --> 00:15:09.240
leakage currents and we will have a look

260
00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:13.889
at how this is a semi-log plot of IDs

261
00:15:13.889 --> 00:15:16.410
versus VDS it illustrates the sub

262
00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:17.750
threshold

263
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.180
a leakage so here the MOSFET is in

264
00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.310
strong inversion and then we have this

265
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:25.700
exponential decay down to at zero gate

266
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.310
voltage I off that is our sub threshold

267
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:33.350
leakage the sub threshold swing in this

268
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:36.440
case 80 millivolts per decade so one

269
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.960
decade for 80 millivolts change in

270
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:44.900
voltage so if we increase the threshold

271
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.900
voltage by eighty millivolts we will

272
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.260
have a decade lower sub threshold

273
00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.590
leakage so we get a 10x reduction in the

274
00:15:54.590 --> 00:16:01.010
sub threshold leakage but it comes at

275
00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:06.620
the cost so in this plot we have plotted

276
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:11.120
the leakage for L level low VT standard

277
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.880
VT and high VT transistors and you see

278
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.820
that leakage decreases partisans at the

279
00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.460
same time the propagation delay is

280
00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:23.060
increasing there is also here a

281
00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.720
relationship between the I of the sub

282
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.120
threshold leakage current at zero gate

283
00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.060
voltage and the gate delay and we see

284
00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:36.920
that when leakage is decreasing

285
00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:42.530
gate delay increases finally we have

286
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:44.900
power gating a method for minimizing

287
00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:47.810
static power dissipation by simply

288
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:49.730
turning off the power to either blocks

289
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.370
using sleep transistors between the

290
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:56.470
power supply and the power gated block

291
00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.380
for power gated blocks we use a virtual

292
00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:06.290
supply line v2 DV and for the we gate

293
00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.770
the block outputs to prevent invalid

294
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:12.970
logic levels to the next block because

295
00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:16.490
we cannot leave the outputs from

296
00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:20.689
unpowered blocks floating the voltage

297
00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:23.390
drop across sleep transistors degrades

298
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.839
performance during normal operation so

299
00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:28.910
we must size sleep transistors wide

300
00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:31.220
enough to minimize impact by

301
00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:32.720
keeping the difference between the

302
00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:38.780
supply voltage is small and switching

303
00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.330
white slip transistors cost dynamic

304
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.789
power so it's only justified when

305
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:49.970
circuit sleeps long enough now let's

306
00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:54.440
return to our textbook example and let's

307
00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.720
have a look again at our 1 billion

308
00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.990
transistor Gipp where we had logic block

309
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:02.419
be 50 million transistors and a memory

310
00:18:02.419 --> 00:18:05.750
on-chip memory 950 million memories

311
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:08.960
transistors what would be the static

312
00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:14.390
power consumption of this chip so all

313
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:18.470
MOSFETs are high VT except 5% of the

314
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:20.690
logic MOSFETs on critical timing paths

315
00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:24.559
that are standard VT the leakage

316
00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:28.669
information is sub threshold leakage for

317
00:18:28.669 --> 00:18:32.659
standard bt 109 amps per micron high VT

318
00:18:32.659 --> 00:18:37.669
10 nano amps per micron gate leakage 5

319
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:40.280
nano amps per micron and Junction

320
00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:47.809
leakage we can neglect that solution the

321
00:18:47.809 --> 00:18:51.130
total gate width of 1 billion MOSFETs is

322
00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:55.130
110 meters distributed the total channel

323
00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:56.659
width of the two and a half million

324
00:18:56.659 --> 00:19:00.110
standard VT logic MOSFET 75 centimeters

325
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.659
total channel which of all the high VT

326
00:19:02.659 --> 00:19:11.510
MOSFETs is 109 point 25 meters sub

327
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:13.940
threshold leakage assuming 50% are

328
00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.789
turned off so we have the standard VT

329
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:21.740
leakage and the high VT leakage the

330
00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:23.630
width of the standard B transistors

331
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:25.909
times its leakage the width of the high

332
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:28.429
VT transistors times the 10 times lower

333
00:19:28.429 --> 00:19:33.730
leakage gives a 585 milliamps

334
00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:36.830
similarly the gate leakage again

335
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:40.159
assuming 50% are turned off so we take

336
00:19:40.159 --> 00:19:43.309
half of the total width of 110 meters

337
00:19:43.309 --> 00:19:45.299
times the gate leakage

338
00:19:45.299 --> 00:19:48.360
nano amps per micron and we get 275

339
00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:54.149
milliamps adding gives us a total static

340
00:19:54.149 --> 00:19:59.009
power dissipation this is the current

341
00:19:59.009 --> 00:20:02.129
multiplied by the voltage 1 volt 860

342
00:20:02.129 --> 00:20:05.700
millivolts and it's the distributed

343
00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:09.330
logic static power is 150 millivolts

344
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:12.059
while the total memory static power is

345
00:20:12.059 --> 00:20:15.919
seven hundred and ten millivolts this

346
00:20:15.919 --> 00:20:18.210
860 milliwatts of static power

347
00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:21.330
dissipation is about 14% of the six

348
00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.600
point one what dynamic power that we

349
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.970
calculated previously and will deplete

350
00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:33.419
batteries of handheld devices rapidly in

351
00:20:33.419 --> 00:20:36.239
summary we have had a look at dynamic

352
00:20:36.239 --> 00:20:38.669
power dissipation where the main source

353
00:20:38.669 --> 00:20:41.190
is repeatedly charging the capacitive

354
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:44.519
circuit notes while logical zeros become

355
00:20:44.519 --> 00:20:47.789
logical ones but we also had a look at

356
00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:50.369
the blips of short-circuit current while

357
00:20:50.369 --> 00:20:52.649
both pull-up and pulldown nets are on

358
00:20:52.649 --> 00:20:56.700
simultaneously during switching then we

359
00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.249
turn to static power dissipation had a

360
00:20:59.249 --> 00:21:01.200
quick look at the drain Junction leakage

361
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.980
which is most often negligible then we

362
00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.649
turned to a gate leakage which we in our

363
00:21:07.649 --> 00:21:10.230
example found could be up to one third

364
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:13.049
of the static power and the main source

365
00:21:13.049 --> 00:21:17.879
the sub threshold leakage then we turned

366
00:21:17.879 --> 00:21:19.440
to low power design and asked ourselves

367
00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:23.460
how can power dissipation be reduced so

368
00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:24.809
we had to look at different methods

369
00:21:24.809 --> 00:21:27.570
including clock gating for reducing the

370
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:31.649
switching activity multi VDD dividing

371
00:21:31.649 --> 00:21:34.320
chips into voltage domains using reduced

372
00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.970
supply voltages for non-critical blocks

373
00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:41.639
DVS dynamic voltage scaling where we

374
00:21:41.639 --> 00:21:43.109
monitored the workload and the

375
00:21:43.109 --> 00:21:45.690
temperature for controlling VDD and the

376
00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:50.070
clock frequency multi VT reducing sub

377
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:52.700
threshold voltage by using power-hungry

378
00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.889
by using power-hungry low VT MOSFETs

379
00:21:55.889 --> 00:21:58.590
only in critical timing paths

380
00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:01.470
and finally power gating where we turn

381
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:04.110
power off to either blocks sending them

382
00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:08.159
into sleep mode so that's it folk folks

383
00:22:08.159 --> 00:22:11.749
thank you very much for listening
