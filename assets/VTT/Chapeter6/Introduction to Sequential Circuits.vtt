1
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.049
in this presentation we will study about

2
00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.540
the sequential circuits a very very

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.790
important presentation in the digital

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.670
electronics course because this is the

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:23.970
base for your flip-flops counters and it

6
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.730
registers all these three topics very

7
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.230
important and there are so many

8
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.119
questions being asked from these three

9
00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.369
topics only so if you want to master

10
00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.140
these three topics you have to

11
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.840
understand what is sequential circuits

12
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.670
first that we will study in this

13
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.250
presentation only there is also a small

14
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.290
change that you will find in the coming

15
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.989
videos and this presentation is the

16
00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.940
lecture number I am mentioning the

17
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.390
lecture number like this is 118 flexure

18
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.879
in the digital electronics course this

19
00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.160
will help the students who are learning

20
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.590
the digital electronics first time okay

21
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.289
so let's move to the sequential circuits

22
00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.170
what it is when we talk about the

23
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.450
sequential circuit it becomes important

24
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.490
for us to talk about the combinational

25
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.799
circuits at the same time okay because

26
00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.740
half of the definition of the sequential

27
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.930
circuit is the combinational circuit

28
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.930
let's see how this is a formal

29
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.200
definition for your sequential circuit

30
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.270
you can use this definition if someone

31
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.070
asks you what a sequential circuit in

32
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.130
your exams as well so in sequential

33
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.280
circuits the present output okay the

34
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.350
first important thing is the present

35
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.500
output depends upon the present input

36
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.860
okay now this two things when combined

37
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.259
together makes your combinational

38
00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.630
circuit in combinational circuit the

39
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.549
present output depends only on the

40
00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.070
present input okay we have to use word

41
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.380
only here for the combinational circuit

42
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.530
because if I say I am having a

43
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.180
combinational circuit that takes two

44
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.520
input the first input is let us say 1

45
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.100
and the second input is also 1 and the

46
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.829
combinational circuit here here adds

47
00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.030
this two numbers so 1 plus 1 gives you

48
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.750
zero as the some and one is the carry

49
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.960
okay so this is the result that we are

50
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.650
having again you are using this same

51
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.140
same adder and you want to add zero and

52
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.390
one then the result will be what one

53
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.630
zero it has nothing to do with this

54
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.570
output okay what was the previous output

55
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.940
let me explain you once more you are

56
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.910
adding one one okay so you are getting

57
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.550
the result 0 1 this is your output okay

58
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.160
now again you are adding different

59
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.160
number let's say 0 1 then the output is

60
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.100
1 0 now this output this is your present

61
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.170
output that we are talking about this

62
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.150
present output is only depending upon

63
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.290
this present input this is your present

64
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.510
input this one is your past input and

65
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.340
this one is your past output fine so

66
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.040
this output the present output has

67
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.910
nothing to do with the past input or the

68
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.900
past output does we call it as the

69
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.269
combinational circuit ok I hope you are

70
00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.760
getting this but in case of sequential

71
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.970
circuit the present output depends upon

72
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.180
the present input as well as as well as

73
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.750
it depends upon the past output or

74
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.970
outputs okay like in this case we are

75
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.980
having two outputs so it depends upon

76
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.060
the past output or outputs as well so

77
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.920
this is the major difference between

78
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.780
your sequential circuit and the

79
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.019
combinational circuit let's see how it

80
00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.400
works for example this is my

81
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.560
combinational circuit this is my input

82
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.900
present input and this is my present

83
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.269
output so the present output depends

84
00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.329
only on the present input now if I say I

85
00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.400
want to convert this combinational

86
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.110
circuit to the sequential circuit then

87
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.090
what I have to do let's see I have to

88
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.620
take this output there are all the three

89
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.470
outputs actually and then store it I

90
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.560
have to store it now let me explain you

91
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.000
why I need to store it counter is the

92
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.750
sequential circuit and you

93
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.580
already know that how counter works

94
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.710
let's say if it is a decimal counter it

95
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.640
comes from zero to nine every time it

96
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.970
adds one to zero then we will get one

97
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.110
then again it adds 1 to 1 we get 2 then

98
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:48.320
2 plus 1 3 then 4 5 6 7 8 9 so every

99
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.180
time it is adding adding 1 to the

100
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.540
previous output because 0 plus 1 gives

101
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.550
us 1 now when you add 1 to 1 we must

102
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.260
know that this one was the previous

103
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.510
output because until and unless you know

104
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.340
what was the previous output how we are

105
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.240
going to add 1 for example if I'm at 5

106
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.210
then the counter will count 6 it will

107
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.090
count 6 only if it knows that the

108
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.820
previous output was 5 until and unless

109
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.830
it knows what was the previous output

110
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.070
how it is going to add 1 so we require

111
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.760
to store we require to store previous

112
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.919
output this is the very important point

113
00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.979
in the sequential circuit we require to

114
00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:36.470
store the previous output so what we

115
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:42.290
need we need a memory ok so what I am

116
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.840
actually doing here I am giving inputs I

117
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.390
am getting the output and also at the

118
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.030
same time and storing that particular

119
00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.780
output on outputs in my memory block we

120
00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.190
will talk about this memory very

121
00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.490
important point this memory will keep

122
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.280
the output till the time I am again

123
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.860
going to use it let's say time came and

124
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.940
we have to use the values stored in this

125
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:13.990
memory and this values will be used as

126
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:20.360
the inputs so let's see what we got here

127
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.280
we are having 3 inputs and these are our

128
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.530
present input then we are having the

129
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.380
output and also we are having the memory

130
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.630
element which has already stored the

131
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.060
output from the previous inputs so this

132
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.020
will become our past output and this

133
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.230
past output will go

134
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.290
the input and you can call it as the

135
00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.960
feedback will go as the feedback and the

136
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.000
present output will depend upon this

137
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.360
present input and the past output so

138
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.540
this is our sequential circuit now let

139
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.940
me explain you the important point

140
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.450
what is this memory okay because in

141
00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.610
sequential circuit everything is

142
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.140
combinational you can see everything is

143
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.510
combinational except this memory and the

144
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.000
feedback so we have to focus on this

145
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.950
memory that what is this memory and how

146
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.230
we are going to store the output and as

147
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.090
we are in the digital world the output

148
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.880
will be 0 or 1 bits you can say so we

149
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.650
have to store the bits how we are going

150
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.470
to do that if we know how to store a

151
00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.350
single bit we later can store multi bits

152
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.920
also so the first thing that came in the

153
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.800
mind of the people is to use cascaded

154
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.620
not gate okay before that let me tell

155
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.840
you this memory is nothing but your

156
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.390
flip-flops okay I have raised the

157
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.270
curtains the suspense is over this

158
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.880
memory is your flip-flops okay but

159
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.950
people didn't get to the flip-flops

160
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.740
directly but they have thought different

161
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.690
methods to store a single bit number

162
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:57.490
earlier it was the Cascade it not gate

163
00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.160
arrangement that can be used to store a

164
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:07.450
single bit okay let's see how these are

165
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.720
your two not gates and if the input is

166
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.890
one or high the output of your first not

167
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.590
gate is 0 and then the output of a

168
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.680
second not gate is 1 so you can see that

169
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.230
this one is stored
