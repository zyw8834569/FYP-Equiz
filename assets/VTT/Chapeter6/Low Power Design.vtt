00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:27.050
so in this week we shall be starting with
some discussions on low power design ah as

2
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.780
you know designing a circuits for low power
has become so much very important in the present

3
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.219
day scenario and it also affects the way vlsi
chips are designed and also in particular

4
00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.510
the physical design process the so called
back end design of the vlsi chips the way

5
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.629
they are done today some techniques and some
rules you can say design rules are incorporated

6
00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:02.969
at various stages of the design so that out
final product the chip consumes less power

7
00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.630
ok
so that is the topic of our discussion today

8
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:17.569
low power vlsi design so as i said power consumption
is ah very big challenge perhaps the most

9
00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:26.390
important challenge in modern day vlsi design
which is pushing performance to a secondary

10
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.860
level the primary reason is that almost all
the devices we use today they are portable

11
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.239
in nature other then of course the desktops
which sit on our tables this portable devices

12
00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:48.700
all run on battery power ok you think of our
mobile phones our laptops our notebooks our

13
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:56.320
tabs everything these are the devices which
we use they all get the energy from the battery

14
00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.740
that is built inside it
so if you can design the circuits that get

15
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.950
embedded into these devices in a way that
they consume less power or energy whatever

16
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:16.220
you call so the battery life of the devices
tend to increase which is extremely desirable

17
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:24.500
from the users prospective ok so there have
been various works and strategies that have

18
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.990
been proposed over the years which try to
reduce the power dissipation so we sometime

19
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:38.630
say that we have added a fourth dimension
to the design process what are the other three

20
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:47.870
dimensions lets see you see this is a typical
picture that will find in several places in

21
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.980
some textbooks also traditionally in this
seventies and eighties area and delay were

22
00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:02.550
the most important parameters
so when someone try to design a circuit a

23
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:10.069
chip the primary emphasis was how much less
area is occupied by my circuits on the chip

24
00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:17.900
on the silicon floor and what is the maximum
speed so we try to reduce the delay [vocalized-noise]

25
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:25.830
now often this area and delay are mutually
conflicting so some typical figure of merits

26
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:35.920
were ah proposed and used one of them was
the product of area and delay square a d square

27
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:42.130
so there there there are number of such have
a matrix which you are used and proposed so

28
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.430
you can have a figure of merit
but as the circuits started to become more

29
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:54.090
and more complex so what happened was that
you see area and delay were not the only parameters

30
00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:01.760
now after a chip is manufactured mean one
very important task of the designers or you

31
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.610
can say the text engineers was to ensure that
the chip does not contain any apparent fabrication

32
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:16.060
defects so the chip needs to go through a
process of testing more the complexity increases

33
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.940
in a chip the task of the testing becomes
more and more difficult

34
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.940
so there has to be some design rules like
the design for testibility techniques that

35
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:34.490
where discussed earlier those have to be incorporated
or embedded in the design process itself so

36
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.940
that whatever circuits we design they are
easily testable so thats why we say that in

37
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:49.440
the eighties and nineties this third axis
of this in this diagram testability came into

38
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:57.590
the picture but now two thousand onwards with
the advent of battery operated mobile devices

39
00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:05.370
portable devices power as become a very important
fourth parameter in this design space

40
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:13.350
so not only we have to address area delay
and testability also you have to address this

41
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:22.030
power consumption issue ok fine so let us
look at some of the terminologies so in a

42
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:29.850
typical chip which in todays technology is
normally built using c mos technology so we

43
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:36.030
say that power is dissipated whenever there
is a current flowing from the power supply

44
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:44.650
which you called the v dd to the ground so
power is drawn from the voltage source and

45
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:53.740
this source i mean sources of these currents
can be various these we shall be seeing subsequently

46
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.760
but let us look at how we typically measure
the power so i shall be explaining this very

47
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:07.970
clearly so we distinguish between instantaneous
power energy and average power so how are

48
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:16.150
they defined see instantaneous power is defined
simple by the product of the current and the

49
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:23.229
voltage the current flowing from v dd to ground
we call it as i dd this is a function of time

50
00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:32.470
t multiplied by the voltage v dd now instantaneous
power does not give us a very clear picture

51
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:39.110
of means how much our battery is getting drain
because it may so happen that sometimes the

52
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.880
instantaneous power is very high but over
long period of time we are consuming very

53
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.380
low power means our currents is very less
ok

54
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:52.820
so some sort of average is more meaningful
instead of the power drawn at a particular

55
00:06:52.820 --> 00:07:02.810
point in time ok so we talk about energy so
how is the energy defined so i shall be explaining

56
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:07.800
these terminologies graphically very shortly
this energy is defined as the integral of

57
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:16.100
the instantaneous power over a period of time
let say capital t zero to t what is the sum

58
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:23.830
of the instantaneous power drawn that aggregation
is defined as the energy this is how you define

59
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:32.620
ok and of course you are computing this energy
over a time period t so if you calculate the

60
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:38.759
average simply divide this e by t you get
the average power

61
00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:46.240
so normally when we evaluate the power consumption
of a circuit or a device or a chip we talk

62
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:52.830
about the energy or the average power now
let us see with the help of a diagram how

63
00:07:52.830 --> 00:08:04.280
these three things are related so let us show
a typical diagram this is the access of time

64
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:14.389
and here we show the instantaneous power consumption
which means the the product of the current

65
00:08:14.389 --> 00:08:21.930
and the voltage lets say we [vocalized-noise]
the value of p t varies with time like this

66
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:34.349
lets say so we are interested to measure the
power between time zero and capital t

67
00:08:34.349 --> 00:08:43.250
now just recalling the definitions for a particular
value of t lets say here so if we try to see

68
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:49.860
what is the corresponding value of p t it
is here this is the value of the instantaneous

69
00:08:49.860 --> 00:09:02.029
power i p instantaneous power at this particular
time lets say t i right now if i want to calculate

70
00:09:02.029 --> 00:09:10.649
the energy so energy as i said is the integral
of pt from zero to capital t so so what is

71
00:09:10.649 --> 00:09:27.390
the physical interpretation of the integral
integral means the area under this curve so

72
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:39.020
this total area under the curve this is defined
as the energy that is integral pt dt between

73
00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:46.890
zero and t
now if you just take the average energy over

74
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:52.500
this time p t [vocalized-noise] it is energy
is varying so possible the average will be

75
00:09:52.500 --> 00:10:02.130
somewhere here you show it as a straight line
so this will give you the average power p

76
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:12.790
avg now as i said p average can be computed
by dividing the energy divide with this time

77
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:20.120
t so we understand this p average is this
level that means the height of this rectangle

78
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:26.050
and energy is the total area height multiplied
by the width and width is capital t

79
00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:31.880
so if we divide this area by capital t you
will be getting this height that means p average

80
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:38.019
ok so diagrammatically i am showing you the
difference between instantaneous power the

81
00:10:38.019 --> 00:10:46.360
energy and the average power ok so let us
come back so talking about [vocalized-noise]

82
00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:53.690
power dissipation in a typical c mos circuit
we can classify the power dissipation into

83
00:10:53.690 --> 00:11:02.760
three types very broadly dynamic short circuit
and static so we shall see what are the sources

84
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:09.690
of these different kinds of powers and what
are the typical methods that are adopted to

85
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:19.290
reduce the effects of these ok
so we shall see this subsequently let us start

86
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:28.300
with dynamic power well [vocalized-noise]
as the name implies dynamic power is something

87
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:37.360
which is depending on the dynamics of the
circuits what is the definition of dynamics

88
00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:44.810
something which changes with time so dynamics
power by its definition means whenever some

89
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:53.390
signals in the circuits are changing those
changes cause some dissipation of power that

90
00:11:53.390 --> 00:12:01.110
is basically what is meant by dynamics power
dissipation so lets try to understand this

91
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:07.180
so basically dynamics power is required for
what purpose for charging and discharging

92
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:13.550
load capacitances with transistor switch
so let us look at very simple example of a

93
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:23.600
c mos inverter
so here i have a p mos transistor and n mos

94
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:31.649
transistor this is my input let say a and
this is my output lets say f so f is given

95
00:12:31.649 --> 00:12:41.250
by the complement of a and this is v dd now
what i am saying is that this output as i

96
00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:47.620
said earlier may be driving the inputs of
other gates so we can equivalently assume

97
00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:58.300
that it is driving a load capacitance lets
say the load capacitance is c so lets say

98
00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:07.269
when the value of a switches from zero to
one lets say the value of f will be switching

99
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:14.640
from one to zero
similarly when a switches back to zero the

100
00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:24.510
value of f will again switch to one now whenever
this output node f changes from high to low

101
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:31.740
and low to high what does this mean whenever
it is changing from high to low this means

102
00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:44.769
c is getting discharged and whenever it is
rising from low to high we say c is getting

103
00:13:44.769 --> 00:13:53.720
charged ok now in this circuits the discharging
path of the capacitor is this through the

104
00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:59.100
pull down transistor and the charging path
of the capacitor is this through the pull

105
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:03.920
up transistor
so as you know in a c mos circuit depending

106
00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:10.540
on the value of a so either the pull up or
the pull down one of the networks is conducting

107
00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:16.529
so depending on that this c will be either
discharging or it will be charging now every

108
00:14:16.529 --> 00:14:23.149
time there is a charging discharging of a
capacitor it will consume ah power because

109
00:14:23.149 --> 00:14:32.350
you recall the basic definition from circuit
theory current is defined as c dv d t so you

110
00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:41.970
can define the current flowing as the product
of the capacitor and the rate of change of

111
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:44.930
voltage
so whenever there is a this kind of charging

112
00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:51.050
discharging going on there will be a current
flowing and the product of currents and voltage

113
00:14:51.050 --> 00:15:01.110
will be the power consumption ok fine so let
us come back to this slide [vocalized-noise]

114
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:06.670
so i have ah just shown in one cycle we can
have a rising output and also falling output

115
00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:14.570
right so whenever there is a rising output
that means the output node is getting charged

116
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:20.639
charge means what the capacitor is getting
charge to v dd so what is the total charge

117
00:15:20.639 --> 00:15:28.389
charge is the product of capacitance and voltage
so c multiplied by v dd this much charge is

118
00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:36.880
required to charge the output node to v dd
similarly when the output goes to zero the

119
00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:45.560
load capacitor needs to discharge to ground
right now it can so happen that lets say we

120
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:55.290
are considering a certain time period t right
now within this time period t the output f

121
00:15:55.290 --> 00:16:01.890
may be going up and going down several times
this may so happen depending on the behavior

122
00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:09.709
of the circuit now if this kind of thing happens
which means in the same interval of time t

123
00:16:09.709 --> 00:16:15.880
the capacitor is getting charged and discharged
multiple number of times see charging discharging

124
00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:19.750
charging discharging charging discharging
ok

125
00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:38.830
so if i define a parameter f sw this is the
frequency of switching then within a time

126
00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:51.079
period t so if you multiple t with f sw this
will be number of switching that is taking

127
00:16:51.079 --> 00:17:01.170
place within this time period t the product
of the time and the frequency of switching

128
00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:14.250
this you can call as the frequency of switching
sw right fine so this already i have ah explained

129
00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:21.490
that if the frequency of output switching
is f sw that charging and discharging cycle

130
00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:31.440
will be repeating so many times over a time
interval t ok

131
00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:38.779
now let us see that how we can calculate the
average dynamic power in a circuit now our

132
00:17:38.779 --> 00:17:47.309
assumption is that we have a circuit like
this where there is a period time t and the

133
00:17:47.309 --> 00:17:55.859
inputs are changing at some rate so i am again
showing that picture that i am concentrating

134
00:17:55.859 --> 00:18:03.369
my calculation within a time period of t and
within the time period t the input or the

135
00:18:03.369 --> 00:18:07.710
output [vocalized-noise] whatever we call
in inverter both will be the same will be

136
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:16.960
changing certain number of times so i am calling
it as the frequency of switch right fine

137
00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:23.700
now let us look at this calculation so how
do we calculate the dynamic power this is

138
00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:33.429
actually the average power consumption so
whenever the output ah is switching so between

139
00:18:33.429 --> 00:18:39.210
time zero and t i simple multiple the current
with the voltages this is the definition of

140
00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:45.489
the instantaneous power you integrate it over
a time t you get the energy take the average

141
00:18:45.489 --> 00:18:51.830
you get the average power ok since v dd is
a constant you take it out so you have an

142
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:57.489
expression like this so let us see how from
here i get this so we get an expression like

143
00:18:57.489 --> 00:19:12.559
this i am just to working this out so you
get v dd divided by t integral zero to t current

144
00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:18.080
d t fine
now let us make an observation so our observation

145
00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:26.679
is the value of current is defined as the
product of the capacitance and the rate of

146
00:19:26.679 --> 00:19:38.409
change of voltage so if you take this into
account so i dd tdt becomes c dv so i can

147
00:19:38.409 --> 00:19:51.479
write it as v dd by t integral c dv now the
independent variable is v so what will be

148
00:19:51.479 --> 00:19:58.720
the range of v see i am working from zero
to t so this will be from zero to what something

149
00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:04.850
i am writing a question mark here because
you see a within this time t as i said charging

150
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:11.779
and discharging will take place multiple number
of times right multiple number of [vocalized-noise]

151
00:20:11.779 --> 00:20:21.480
so far each charging i can say each charging
the voltages is going from zero to approximately

152
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:34.229
v dd in the load capacitor and for discharging
it is the reverse v dd back to zero

153
00:20:34.229 --> 00:20:45.039
now in each such cycle i can write it like
this v dd by t see c dv is nothing but c into

154
00:20:45.039 --> 00:20:56.029
v now since this charging upto v dd so for
every charging it will be c into v dd not

155
00:20:56.029 --> 00:21:02.729
only this how many times it is charging within
this period t it is charging if s w multiplied

156
00:21:02.729 --> 00:21:12.279
by t times as i said so f sw multiplied by
t this will give you at how many times this

157
00:21:12.279 --> 00:21:17.909
charging and discharging is taking place within
this time period t so you will have to multiple

158
00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:27.239
this by this t into f sw this will give you
the total value of the integrate see here

159
00:21:27.239 --> 00:21:34.009
basically this integral you are separating
out between these each of these segments one

160
00:21:34.009 --> 00:21:40.899
two three so thats why if you just add them
out there are so many such segments you multiple

161
00:21:40.899 --> 00:21:48.200
this by this right
so how much this comes to if you make a simplification

162
00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:59.009
c v dd square capital t cancels out and f
sw this is the final expression for dynamics

163
00:21:59.009 --> 00:22:08.659
power right ok so in this expression also
this same thing is shown finally the value

164
00:22:08.659 --> 00:22:13.630
of the dynamics power is this and the point
to observe here is that the dynamics power

165
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:20.720
is proportional to load capacitance so to
reduce it you can try and reduce the value

166
00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:26.809
of c proportional to square of v dd so if
it is possible to reduce the supply voltage

167
00:22:26.809 --> 00:22:32.639
that will also be good and of course proportional
to the signal switching frequency

168
00:22:32.639 --> 00:22:42.470
so if you can reduce the frequency that will
also result in less dynamics power ok now

169
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:47.889
taking the concept of dynamic power one step
forward let us define something called an

170
00:22:47.889 --> 00:22:57.200
activity factor now see in the previous expression
we talked about this f sw which was the frequency

171
00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:04.490
of switching of the input or the output signals
right now here we are talking about the clock

172
00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:14.359
frequency f is our clock frequency now we
are trying to relate this f sw with f by multiplying

173
00:23:14.359 --> 00:23:19.259
it with the parameter alpha which is defined
as the activity factor

174
00:23:19.259 --> 00:23:26.609
you see some signal can change state at a
rate which is at most equal to the clock frequency

175
00:23:26.609 --> 00:23:33.070
because it is the clock the edges of the clock
that defines the various events in a circuits

176
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:40.379
but all edges of the clock need not result
in a change in the signal state so only a

177
00:23:40.379 --> 00:23:47.960
fraction of the clock edges will actually
result in an activity that will result in

178
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:54.309
consumption of dynamics power so we define
something called an activity factor which

179
00:23:54.309 --> 00:24:04.269
if we multiplied by the frequency we get f
sw this is how we just estimate f sw now if

180
00:24:04.269 --> 00:24:10.170
you are directly connecting the clock with
the gate input so the input as well as the

181
00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:13.059
output will be changing at every edge of the
clock

182
00:24:13.059 --> 00:24:21.139
so there we say alpha equal to one but if
the gate output switches once per clock cycles

183
00:24:21.139 --> 00:24:26.609
see once per clock cycle means or in every
clock cycle the clock is transiting twice

184
00:24:26.609 --> 00:24:32.749
low to high and high to low i am saying that
the output is changing once for every two

185
00:24:32.749 --> 00:24:41.830
transitions of the clock so here the activity
factor is defined as half and we have something

186
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:47.700
was c mos dynamics gates i have not talked
about it c mos dynamics gates are something

187
00:24:47.700 --> 00:25:13.019
like this say you can implement ah [vocalized-noise]
this is a p type transistor

188
00:25:13.019 --> 00:25:20.309
so you see in a dynamics c mos dynamics logic
we are not using many transistors in the pull

189
00:25:20.309 --> 00:25:32.440
up this is the output this is a nor nor gate
so here in the [vocalized-noise] pull up network

190
00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:37.210
we are using very few number of time here
only one and you see you are using a clock

191
00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:43.460
phi one and phi two it is like a two face
clock so how it works let me just briefly

192
00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:54.799
tell you lets say phi one s running like this
and phi two is running like this they are

193
00:25:54.799 --> 00:26:04.309
non overlapping right so when phi one equal
to one phi one bar will be zero and this will

194
00:26:04.309 --> 00:26:10.850
be conducting so it is here so the output
load capacitance will be here this is your

195
00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:19.899
c so it is during this period when phi one
is high you call this stage as the precharge

196
00:26:19.899 --> 00:26:26.119
stage during this period phi two is zero so
this transistor is off

197
00:26:26.119 --> 00:26:34.229
so capacitance if getting charged through
v dd this is the precharge state but when

198
00:26:34.229 --> 00:26:40.619
phi is two this part then phi one is back
to zero so this transistors is off the capacitor

199
00:26:40.619 --> 00:26:46.429
was already charged the phi two is high means
this is conducting now depending on a and

200
00:26:46.429 --> 00:26:56.519
b this capacitor can discharge or may not
discharge so we call this as the compute phase

201
00:26:56.519 --> 00:27:00.739
so depending on the phases of phi one and
phi two you can alternate so depending on

202
00:27:00.739 --> 00:27:06.889
the value of a and b the output value may
change it may not change while [vocalized-noise]

203
00:27:06.889 --> 00:27:12.109
in every cycle worst case it can change twice
during precharge state it can go from zero

204
00:27:12.109 --> 00:27:18.590
to high again during compute state it can
go back to from high to low right

205
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:25.869
so this is actually mentioned here that for
a c mos dynamics gate switching takes place

206
00:27:25.869 --> 00:27:34.809
either zero to two times for an average of
alpha equal to half because two times per

207
00:27:34.809 --> 00:27:40.779
cycle means alpha equal to one zero means
zero so average is half but for c mos static

208
00:27:40.779 --> 00:27:47.129
gates conventional c mos gates ah the activity
factor is very much dependent on the design

209
00:27:47.129 --> 00:27:56.080
the typical value is around point one so if
you take the activity factor into account

210
00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:04.610
our dynamics power equation changes to this
square you replace f sw by alpha into f right

211
00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:13.009
so alpha is also a factor here
now we look at short circuit power short circuit

212
00:28:13.009 --> 00:28:20.580
power this is some kind of power dissipation
in a c mos gate when the signals transitions

213
00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:27.230
are taking place because they are periodically
for very small amount of time both n mos and

214
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:34.999
p mos networks can be conducting this is also
called as the crowbar current and in modern

215
00:28:34.999 --> 00:28:43.679
day designs this short circuit power can consume
so means of the tune of ah twenty percent

216
00:28:43.679 --> 00:28:49.359
of the total power dissipation right and faster
is the frequency of switching more will be

217
00:28:49.359 --> 00:28:55.239
the short circuits power ok because as you
increases the clock frequency the transitions

218
00:28:55.239 --> 00:28:58.799
frequency will also increase
so let us see how it [vocalized-noise] how

219
00:28:58.799 --> 00:29:08.950
this happens ah we take ah simple c mos inverter
where you say that the input is going from

220
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:14.809
zero to high and high and low you see the
input zero to one and one to zero cannot be

221
00:29:14.809 --> 00:29:20.009
instantaneous they will be a rise time and
a fall time ok and this is a typical input

222
00:29:20.009 --> 00:29:26.240
output characteristic curve of the inverter
there is a region where the p mos transistor

223
00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:31.839
is either fully on or partially on and there
is a region where the n mos transistor is

224
00:29:31.839 --> 00:29:38.210
either fully on or partially on there is an
intermediate region where the transitions

225
00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:44.700
is very fast a short range of voltage during
which both the n mos and p mos transistors

226
00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:50.599
may be conducting
so what might happen is that ah suppose the

227
00:29:50.599 --> 00:29:58.960
output of the circuit so it is changing from
zero to one it is changing from one to zero

228
00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:04.999
so if i also plot the value of currents drawn
from v dd normally in a c mos currents currents

229
00:30:04.999 --> 00:30:12.429
drawn in very low but during transitions will
find that they will be a small spike here

230
00:30:12.429 --> 00:30:17.320
because momentarily both the pull up and pull
downs are conducting and higher the value

231
00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:24.169
of the frequency more will be the spikes coming
in right this is the source of the so called

232
00:30:24.169 --> 00:30:33.859
short circuits current ok and lastly we talk
about static power static power is something

233
00:30:33.859 --> 00:30:39.499
which is dissipated even when no signal transitions
are occurring

234
00:30:39.499 --> 00:30:47.419
these occur mainly due to the leakage effects
so even if he transistors are off non conducting

235
00:30:47.419 --> 00:30:52.440
due to some see the junctions can be modulus
some reverse bias diodes which are [vocalized-noise]

236
00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:57.979
not conducting there can be drain junction
leakage sub threshold current many such sources

237
00:30:57.979 --> 00:31:04.369
are their gate leakage because of this kind
of effects a small amount of current will

238
00:31:04.369 --> 00:31:09.909
continuously be flowing ok so this leakage
power will always be there this cannot be

239
00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:19.019
avoided but of course you can reduce it by
using some techniques so so as the transistors

240
00:31:19.019 --> 00:31:24.349
becoming smaller larger and larger number
of transistor have been packed into a chip

241
00:31:24.349 --> 00:31:29.929
the total contributions of static power dissipation
is becoming more important because now in

242
00:31:29.929 --> 00:31:34.610
a chip we have of the order of a billion of
transistor billions of transistors and each

243
00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:40.129
of the transistor is consuming little bit
of energy or power so the sum total if you

244
00:31:40.129 --> 00:31:45.529
take over all billions transistors it can
become significant right

245
00:31:45.529 --> 00:31:51.019
so i am not going to the detail there can
be several sources of these leakage currents

246
00:31:51.019 --> 00:31:56.479
sub threshold leakage reversed bias junctions
channel punch through oxide leakage etcetera

247
00:31:56.479 --> 00:32:06.440
ok so by doing some design manipulations you
can control some of these so we shall see

248
00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:13.259
some of these techniques later so with this
we come to the end of this introductory introductory

249
00:32:13.259 --> 00:32:19.099
lecture on low power design in our next lectures
we shall be moving in to some more details

250
00:32:19.099 --> 00:32:25.669
about how we can actually control power dissipations
by some design techniques
