00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.770
hello everyone welcome back to my

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.140
channel in today's video we are going to

3
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.700
see different types of power dissipation

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.790
in CMOS circuits so without any delay

5
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.450
let's get started

6
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:18.710
[Music]

7
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.980
the total power that is dissipated can

8
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.070
be broadly classified into two types

9
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.590
static and dynamic now let's see what is

10
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.130
static power static power is the power

11
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.890
dissipated by a transistor when it is

12
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.230
not switching and when the transistor is

13
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.960
not searching when the input at the gate

14
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.330
of a transistor is not transitioning

15
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.720
either from 0 to 1 or from 1 to zero in

16
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.540
that case a transistor is in a static

17
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.850
mode and that's why dissipate static

18
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.559
power the static power dissipation is

19
00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.199
mainly in the form of leakage that's why

20
00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.860
it is also called leakage power now we

21
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.110
can have various types of leakage in a

22
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.720
CMOS circuit let's look into them one by

23
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.320
one so what is a threshold leakage as

24
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.600
the name suggests something which

25
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.150
happens below threshold so let's

26
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.400
understand this with an example let's

27
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.280
take an N Mo's we know that n MOS is on

28
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.560
when VG's is greater than VT

29
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.469
and when vgs drops below the threshold

30
00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:28.869
voltage that is when VG's is less than

31
00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.369
VT and MOS is supposed to be off right

32
00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.380
but in real transistors the current does

33
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.990
not abruptly cut off below threshold but

34
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.140
rather she drops off exponentially

35
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.820
therefore even when VG's is less than VT

36
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.399
for a small amount of time there is a

37
00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.619
current that flows between drain to

38
00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.229
source and that current is called sub

39
00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.520
threshold leakage current now let's move

40
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.859
on to gate leakage now as the name

41
00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.049
suggests it is the leakage that happens

42
00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.390
through gate so basically when this gate

43
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.640
oxide is very thin that it allows the

44
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.250
current to pass through it then it leads

45
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.119
to leakage current gate leakage current

46
00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.040
now let's see what is Junction leakage

47
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.070
we know that in a CMOS transistor there

48
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.040
are so many PN junctions and these PN

49
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.470
junctions form diodes and these diodes

50
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.530
are in reverse bias and we know that

51
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.750
there is still a small amount of current

52
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.909
that flows through a reverse bias diode

53
00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.849
that small amount of current is the

54
00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.319
major cause of Junction leakage

55
00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.329
now this was about the static power or

56
00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.549
leakage power now let's move on to

57
00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.810
dynamic power now what is dynamic power

58
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.689
so dynamic power is dissipated when a

59
00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:49.719
circuit is active now when a circuit is

60
00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:52.689
active but circuit is said to be active

61
00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.239
when the voltage on its input net is

62
00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.790
changing due to some stimulus applied

63
00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.849
now it is to be noted that the change in

64
00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.219
the voltage of input net may or may not

65
00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.470
lead to change in the logic state of

66
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.260
output but in both the cases whether

67
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.359
there is change in output net or not if

68
00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.939
there is change in the input net voltage

69
00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:16.409
then dynamic power will be dissipated

70
00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.969
now again dynamic power can be

71
00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:20.889
classified in two types which in power

72
00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.349
and internal power let's look at

73
00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.829
searching power first now as we saw when

74
00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.469
the voltage at input net is changing it

75
00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:31.810
may or may not lead to the change in

76
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.569
logic state of output but let's consider

77
00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.239
the case that when the change in input

78
00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.120
is also leading to the change in output

79
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.040
that's when the switching power comes

80
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.489
into the picture so switching power is

81
00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.889
the power which is dissipated while

82
00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.169
charging or discharging the load

83
00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.560
capacitor at the output of the cell now

84
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.379
let's understand this with an example so

85
00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.659
let's save an input is changing from 1

86
00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:02.769
to 0 the PMO's will turn on and when P

87
00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.319
Mo's will turn on it will charge this

88
00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:11.139
output load to VDD when P MOS is on the

89
00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:13.780
energy supplied by this power supply is

90
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.899
C VDD square and when the P MOS is

91
00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:19.690
charging this capacitor to VDD the

92
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.750
energy stored in this capacitor is half

93
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.560
clvdd square now notice only the half of

94
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.659
the energy which has been taken from

95
00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:30.880
this power supply is used to charge this

96
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.039
charge this capacitor so now the

97
00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.380
question is very dressed half of the

98
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.229
energy go so rest half of the energy is

99
00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.419
dissipated as heat in the P Mo's

100
00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.210
transistor and now when the input

101
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.150
changes back to one from zero the P Mo's

102
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.230
turns off and

103
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.020
and mass turns on and the energy which

104
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.270
was stored in this output capacitor is

105
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.380
discharged to zero through n Mo's so

106
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.970
here is the written version of whatever

107
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.700
I explained I will give you seconds to

108
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:08.050
read this so now this is the switching

109
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.530
power equation so we know that 1/2 clvdd

110
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.680
square is the energy and alpha is the

111
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.520
switching factor so if input switches

112
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.680
alpha x in a cycle then alpha will be

113
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.860
such in factor and remember that for

114
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.020
switching power not only change in the

115
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.870
input is important but that change in

116
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.490
input should also lead to change in

117
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.550
output so if input is switching alpha

118
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.760
times in a cycle and if that input

119
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.320
transition is causing output transition

120
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.930
as well then we would say that switching

121
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.900
factor is alpha and our equation for

122
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.080
switching power will be half alpha clvdd

123
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.120
square into frequency now as we saw the

124
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.550
dynamic power has two components which

125
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.040
in power and internal power now we will

126
00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.880
see what is internal power now as the

127
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.980
name suggests internal power is the

128
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.890
power which is dissipated internal to

129
00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.110
the cell that is which is dissipated

130
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.260
within the boundary of a cell it can

131
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.780
again be divided in two parts short

132
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.760
circuit power which we will see in a bi

133
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.430
and the power which is needed to charge

134
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.250
or discharge the internal nodes of a

135
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.080
transistor so basically there will be

136
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.910
some internal capacitance in a

137
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.850
transistor so to charge or discharge

138
00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.710
whatever power is needed that is also

139
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.570
comes that also comes with an internal

140
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:36.040
power now by definition short circuit

141
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.200
power is the power which is dissipated

142
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.080
when both P Mo's and n MOS are

143
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.300
simultaneously on during input

144
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.540
transition now to understand this

145
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.020
definition let's consider this scenario

146
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.610
let's say the input is switching from

147
00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.060
VSS to VDD and we know that P MOS is on

148
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.390
when the input is between VSS to VDD

149
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.670
minus VT and and more

150
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.480
is on when the input is from VT to VDD

151
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.070
so between this period that is from VT

152
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.910
to VDD minus VT both PMO's and NMOS are

153
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.460
on that is during this time there is a

154
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.320
direct current flow from VDD to ground

155
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.390
this direct current flow from VDD to

156
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.030
ground leads to short-circuit current

157
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.900
and which leads to short-circuit power

158
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.240
so this was all from my side please let

159
00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.860
me know your feedback in the comment
