1
00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:03.760
we want to design a circuit

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.160
that will behave like this we have four

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.359
states state zero

4
00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.639
zero your output is one here for this

5
00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:12.719
state

6
00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.720
this is zero one your output is zero

7
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.640
this is one zero your output is one

8
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.960
and this is i should lower this one one

9
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.760
your output

10
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.880
is zero let me lower these just a little

11
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.760
bit just this one

12
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.680
give me more space zero one

13
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.879
your output is zero and if you put a

14
00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:39.280
zero

15
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.160
you wanna stay there

16
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.840
if you put a one

17
00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.320
you're gonna go down to this one if your

18
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.320
input is one

19
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.840
if your input is zero you go right here

20
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.199
if your input is one you go right here

21
00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.199
if your input is zero you stay right

22
00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:00.640
here

23
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.719
if your input is one you go right there

24
00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.680
if your input is zero from here you go

25
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.360
right there if your input is one you go

26
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.680
right here

27
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.880
i want to build this circuit

28
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.880
what's the bottom line one

29
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.000
if you put a one there

30
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.360
and we'll decide maybe i'll use jk for

31
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.880
this flip i want to build the circuit

32
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.400
that will behave like this i have four

33
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.520
states

34
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.840
zero zero zero one one zero one one

35
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.079
and i have an output either one or zero

36
00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:54.720
i see the output and there's my input

37
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.479
since i have four states

38
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.719
two to the power of the number of

39
00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.960
flip-flops number

40
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.159
of flip-flops

41
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.399
has to be greater than or equal to the

42
00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.360
number of states

43
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.360
so that will tell us how many flip flops

44
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.959
we're going to use

45
00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.120
how many states do i have here 4

46
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.160
so 2 to what power

47
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.360
is going to make it greater than or

48
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.360
equal to 4 2.

49
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.840
so i will need two flip flops

50
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.160
and i'm going to use jk no reason i just

51
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160
first that came to my mind jake here

52
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.599
because i looked that sheet was right in

53
00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.440
front of me

54
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.959
that's how i use jk for that

55
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.360
so to design that i have to draw

56
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.519
the table and see where my options are

57
00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.879
so before we get to that

58
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.680
we have q1 which is state 1 and q2

59
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.440
state 2. not like state one

60
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.680
two digits you know this and that this

61
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.640
is one and two

62
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.519
see them one and two one and two one and

63
00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.720
two that's what i meant by

64
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.440
q1 q2 if it's zero zero we're talking

65
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.319
about that state

66
00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.680
you also have what one

67
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.959
input and that's what you want to call

68
00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.360
it x

69
00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.799
so this is the input here

70
00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.560
this is the current states

71
00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.159
q1 q2 are the current states this is x

72
00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.239
my input

73
00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.000
my output is the next states

74
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.519
what is q1 asterisk

75
00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.879
and q2 asterisk

76
00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.720
also says z is my output

77
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.120
is it zero or one you can see that zero

78
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.839
one

79
00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:28.479
zero these are the outputs

80
00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.280
now if i am at state zero zero

81
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.919
and my input is zero according to this

82
00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.840
picture what happened

83
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.520
you are still there your next state

84
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.280
right

85
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.919
and you have an output yes one

86
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.600
but if i am at state 0 0

87
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.360
and my input is one

88
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.800
where do you go to one

89
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.160
zero is there an output there

90
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.840
one

91
00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:16.720
if i am at state 0 1

92
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.479
and my input is 0 0 1 and 0

93
00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.000
you go where to 0 zero what's your

94
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.600
output one

95
00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.960
if i'm at this state and i put a one

96
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.680
zero one

97
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.639
and my input is one i'm gonna go to one

98
00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.840
zero my output is one

99
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.840
if i'm state one zero

100
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.080
and my input is zero one zero i put a

101
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.360
zero i stay there

102
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.320
my output is one

103
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.680
if i'm a one zero and i put a one

104
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.400
one zero you put a one where do you go

105
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.160
to one one and there's no output

106
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.919
if i'm state 1 1

107
00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:22.400
and my input is zero see it's zero

108
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.319
you go to zero zero your output is one

109
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.840
if i'm at one one my input is one right

110
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.280
here

111
00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.199
you go to zero one and your output is

112
00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:37.520
zero

113
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:48.880
that's the truth table for it

114
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.199
well i'm going to use jk of flip-flops

115
00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:53.440
hmm

116
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.840
i need to take another look at the jk

117
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.319
flip-flop

118
00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:01.840
because what i need to do now figure out

119
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.479
what do i need to connect to the j

120
00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:07.680
because this is what my current state

121
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.759
this one my next state

122
00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:11.840
what is j and k should be to go from

123
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.560
here to there

124
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.039
so let me take a look back at the jk

125
00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:18.720
flip-flop let me hold the sheet of paper

126
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.360
for a second

127
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.960
this can stay here let me write the jk

128
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:31.840
flip-flop on a clean sheet

129
00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:34.800
q

130
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.599
and this is the q next

131
00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:46.400
i'm looking at that table zero zero zero

132
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.160
that's a zero

133
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.360
zero zero one that's a one

134
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.800
zero one zero that's a zero

135
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.759
zero one one that's a zero

136
00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:03.039
one zero zero

137
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.240
that's a one one zero

138
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.360
one that's a one

139
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.520
one one zero that's a one

140
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.599
and one one one that's a zero

141
00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:23.280
now i want to look backward to go from

142
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.319
zero to zero

143
00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:28.160
hmm let me just throw a line so i know

144
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.800
which one is which

145
00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:43.839
from zero to zero i see that right here

146
00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:45.440
cm that's the current state that's the

147
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.200
next state

148
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.040
it looks like it the only way that will

149
00:08:52.839 --> 00:08:54.959
happen

150
00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:58.480
let's see what j and k should be

151
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.560
from zero to zero you could have zero

152
00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.959
zero that'll keep it there or what

153
00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:08.080
or zero one

154
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.200
which means what as long as

155
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.839
j is zero and who cares what k is

156
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.880
as long as j is zero and who cares what

157
00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:19.600
k is

158
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.279
i will go from zero to zero

159
00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:25.519
you can see the two cases right here and

160
00:09:25.519 --> 00:09:27.680
right here

161
00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.279
this is the current state that's the

162
00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:30.959
next state the current state that's the

163
00:09:30.959 --> 00:09:32.800
next state when you had zero zero you

164
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.839
got that

165
00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:35.680
when you got zero one you got that so as

166
00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.760
long as you have a zero for j

167
00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.040
and it's really up to you you can make

168
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.560
it a zero or a one it doesn't matter

169
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.160
that'll keep me from zero to zero

170
00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:46.320
the next group let me look at a

171
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.600
different color

172
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.680
i wanna go from zero to one let's find

173
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.720
out where the zero two one is

174
00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.000
zero to one i see one here you see it

175
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.200
and i see one here this is q and that's

176
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.000
the next state

177
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.200
q on the next state

178
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.680
it looks like it what 1 0 will do it

179
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.120
or 1 1 will do it so as long as j

180
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:19.839
is 1 and who cares what k is

181
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.040
next let me do

182
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.480
the one to zero where's the one to zero

183
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.040
that's this case

184
00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:37.440
in this case cm the two in red

185
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.519
zero one will do it one one will do it

186
00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:47.839
isn't that don't care in one

187
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.760
and the last one

188
00:10:52.079 --> 00:10:55.279
it's one two one

189
00:10:56.959 --> 00:11:00.240
one two one that's this and that

190
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.320
zero and zero will do it

191
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.880
one and zero will do it don't care and

192
00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:15.519
zero

193
00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:18.720
now bring this one back

194
00:11:21.839 --> 00:11:24.560
here's the first flip-flop let me take a

195
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:29.839
look at it

196
00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:50.640
so let's look at this one

197
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.560
and compare it to that one that's the

198
00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.000
current state that's the next

199
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.600
state so let's see what is

200
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:04.079
this is j and k now what is j1

201
00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:07.760
and k1 should be zero to zero let's look

202
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.200
right here

203
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.959
zero to zero zero and don't care

204
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.360
zero to one one and don't care

205
00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:27.200
zero to zero zero and don't care

206
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.720
zero to one one and don't care

207
00:12:32.959 --> 00:12:39.680
one to one don't care in zero one to one

208
00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.800
don't care in zero

209
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.200
one to zero don't care on one

210
00:12:47.279 --> 00:12:53.839
and one to zero don't care in one

211
00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.639
now i'm going to do another one for the

212
00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:04.720
second flip-flop j2

213
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.720
and k2 and that's what i was looking for

214
00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.200
my marker the different color

215
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.480
i don't have it so i'll just do this

216
00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.279
look right here

217
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.600
and compare it to this one it's easy to

218
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.800
lose track where you're looking

219
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.600
i need to slide it down because i have

220
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.480
to look at that table

221
00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.839
zero to zero

222
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.680
zero and don't care

223
00:13:40.399 --> 00:13:43.600
zero to zero zero and donkey

224
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.160
huh because it doesn't matter if it's

225
00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.839
one or zero

226
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.320
one to zero don't care in one

227
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.600
one to zero don't care in one

228
00:14:00.399 --> 00:14:03.920
zero to zero don't care and i mean zero

229
00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.480
and don't care

230
00:14:07.199 --> 00:14:12.000
zero two one one and don't care

231
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:17.839
one to zero don't care on one

232
00:14:18.079 --> 00:14:22.399
and one two one don't care and zero

233
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.240
now i'm ready to design them

234
00:14:29.279 --> 00:14:32.639
i'm ready to build my circuit

235
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.399
i just got to do a truth uh k map for

236
00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:39.360
this

237
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.639
k map for this k map for this

238
00:14:42.639 --> 00:14:47.760
k map for that build it ready to go

239
00:14:51.199 --> 00:14:53.920
we got time

240
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.839
so let's do a k-map

241
00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:09.040
k-map for the first one we'll do j1 then

242
00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.360
we'll do k1 then j2 and k2 well you know

243
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.399
let me save that nice sheet

244
00:15:14.399 --> 00:15:18.639
so a kml j1 k1

245
00:15:20.959 --> 00:15:27.839
we have three inputs

246
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.720
q1 q2 and x

247
00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:40.000
this is for j1

248
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:55.759
we have one for k one

249
00:15:55.759 --> 00:16:09.839
we have one for j2

250
00:16:20.839 --> 00:16:23.839
k2

251
00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.519
and let's go back and fill them in

252
00:16:39.839 --> 00:16:42.959
j1 0

253
00:16:42.959 --> 00:16:47.040
1 that's the j

254
00:16:47.839 --> 00:16:51.199
0 1 0 1

255
00:16:51.199 --> 00:16:53.040
don't care don't care don't care don't

256
00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.279
care

257
00:16:57.279 --> 00:17:00.079
k1 don't care don't care don't care

258
00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:03.199
don't care for them

259
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.880
zero zero one one

260
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.160
j two zero zero

261
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.319
don't care don't care zero one don't

262
00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:16.480
care don't care

263
00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:20.720
so zero zero don't care don't care

264
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:26.160
zero one don't care don't care

265
00:17:26.559 --> 00:17:29.919
k2 don't care don't care

266
00:17:29.919 --> 00:17:33.520
one one don't care don't care

267
00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.480
one zero

268
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.559
and let's read each one then we'll build

269
00:17:42.559 --> 00:17:44.640
it

270
00:17:45.039 --> 00:17:47.840
since i'm only have to group the ones so

271
00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.679
if i take these four ones together

272
00:17:51.919 --> 00:17:55.360
better than just taking two ones

273
00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:01.840
and that'll be what x

274
00:18:01.919 --> 00:18:04.799
this one here

275
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:15.039
take that together what do you have q2

276
00:18:15.039 --> 00:18:17.679
this one

277
00:18:19.039 --> 00:18:29.760
that'll be what q1x

278
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.400
this one

279
00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:39.200
that'll be what q2 plus

280
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.679
if i group these guys together

281
00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:48.880
x i could just took this one with this

282
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:57.840
x naught yeah

283
00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.679
the last one i could just group the

284
00:19:01.679 --> 00:19:02.640
zeros here

285
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.919
you know i could take this with that

286
00:19:03.919 --> 00:19:05.200
group the zero now give me the same

287
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.360
thing

288
00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.039
x is one you complement it and

289
00:19:11.039 --> 00:19:13.280
q

290
00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:24.160
if i take these two will be q one not

291
00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.640
so that's q1 oh i read the first one

292
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.480
wrong right

293
00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.799
here that should be q1 not isn't it for

294
00:19:30.799 --> 00:19:39.039
the first group

295
00:19:39.039 --> 00:19:43.039
that's q1 not it's a zero complement

296
00:19:43.039 --> 00:19:46.080
and this one is x complement

297
00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.640
if you took by the way these two here if

298
00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.240
you group these two if you decide to go

299
00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.080
group the zeros because you can take

300
00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.679
these two what do you have

301
00:19:53.679 --> 00:19:57.120
q1 being one so you complement that or

302
00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.320
x complement same thing

303
00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.480
so now i'm almost ready for my flip-flop

304
00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.320
i got to build it bring the flip-flops i

305
00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.480
need two of them

306
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.080
so where is that sheet of paper that i

307
00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.400
saved

308
00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:14.559
here we go

309
00:20:16.559 --> 00:20:18.080
oh i need to make one also for the

310
00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.159
output which i forgot to make

311
00:20:20.159 --> 00:20:22.480
another k-map for the output to see when

312
00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:26.000
do you get a candy when you don't get a

313
00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.840
candy

314
00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:46.799
this is for z one one

315
00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:49.919
one one one zero

316
00:20:49.919 --> 00:20:52.799
one zero if we just group the zeros the

317
00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:54.960
same thing

318
00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:59.520
that'll be what q one naught or

319
00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:03.840
x naught

320
00:21:04.559 --> 00:21:08.000
that happens to be the same thing

321
00:21:08.799 --> 00:21:16.720
as one of the gates we just did q1

322
00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.440
plus x naught

323
00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.480
and now i just got to build them connect

324
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:25.760
them now i'm ready to go

325
00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:31.840
i have a ruler

326
00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:37.840
now i gotta build them i have two

327
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.640
flip-flops j and k

328
00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.360
we're using right j and k there we go

329
00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.159
there's one of them

330
00:21:52.559 --> 00:21:54.960
i don't know why i'm using lined paper i

331
00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.880
should be on the line

332
00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.840
but i'm not

333
00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.799
that's the second flip-flop i can put

334
00:22:12.799 --> 00:22:14.159
them one after the other i can put them

335
00:22:14.159 --> 00:22:17.679
next to each other really doesn't matter

336
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:22.640
i'm putting them like next to each other

337
00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.080
on top of each other i could have put

338
00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.440
them one after the other to get the

339
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.799
first digit in the second digit

340
00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.960
we just run wires to the light anyway

341
00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.480
this is

342
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.520
jk number one

343
00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:43.039
this is jk number two

344
00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:47.200
that means this is q1

345
00:22:47.679 --> 00:22:51.120
and this is q1 not

346
00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.480
this is q2

347
00:22:56.799 --> 00:23:00.240
and this is q2 not

348
00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.919
this is j for the first one we'll call

349
00:23:03.919 --> 00:23:05.600
it j1

350
00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:09.840
this is k for the other one

351
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.320
i mean for the same one k1 this is j4

352
00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.360
this one j2 this is k

353
00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:21.600
which is k2 we might have a clock here

354
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.440
i don't know how the clock is on the

355
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.520
falling edge rising edge doesn't really

356
00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.840
matter

357
00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.799
so it depends on how they come so

358
00:23:30.799 --> 00:23:37.840
there'll be a clock running this way

359
00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.960
to make sure they're in sync not one

360
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.279
going up one down different times

361
00:23:45.279 --> 00:23:46.799
doesn't make any sense we have to make

362
00:23:46.799 --> 00:23:48.960
sure that they work with the clock

363
00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.840
together

364
00:23:53.039 --> 00:23:57.919
so this is the clock c l k clock

365
00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.640
so they'll be synced together they rise

366
00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.840
at the same time they fall at the same

367
00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.240
time

368
00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:07.600
now let's look at j1

369
00:24:07.919 --> 00:24:11.120
what are you gonna attach to it

370
00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.159
just x we have an external input x we

371
00:24:14.159 --> 00:24:15.360
have a switch you and i gonna be

372
00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:16.640
flipping in the lab

373
00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.080
that's the only input we have is that

374
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.720
switch one input

375
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.799
when you look at this we have three

376
00:24:22.799 --> 00:24:23.919
inputs

377
00:24:23.919 --> 00:24:26.559
q1 q2 these are these i don't control

378
00:24:26.559 --> 00:24:27.520
them these

379
00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.440
i only control that switch the external

380
00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.840
switch it's either zero or one

381
00:24:33.919 --> 00:24:36.159
so now i'm going to have x my switch

382
00:24:36.159 --> 00:24:38.880
here and that's what j1 is attached to

383
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:42.559
x to that switch

384
00:24:44.559 --> 00:24:48.799
k1 is attached to what

385
00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.919
q2 right so i'm going to take the output

386
00:24:51.919 --> 00:24:52.880
of this

387
00:24:52.880 --> 00:25:01.840
feed it to this one

388
00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:15.840
i'll just go diagonal here

389
00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.400
run a wire there

390
00:25:23.039 --> 00:25:26.159
and that's what k1

391
00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.279
just i mean k1 is whatever this you just

392
00:25:29.279 --> 00:25:32.159
run a wire from here to there

393
00:25:32.159 --> 00:25:36.480
j2 has to be an and gate with q1 and x

394
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:42.880
an and gate

395
00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:46.159
with q1 and x

396
00:25:46.559 --> 00:25:56.799
let me push it back just a little bit x

397
00:25:56.799 --> 00:25:58.320
so you're going to take an input from

398
00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.559
here

399
00:26:05.919 --> 00:26:11.840
right there feed it through this

400
00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.559
and the other one from q1

401
00:26:16.559 --> 00:26:18.640
take one wrap it around here wire

402
00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:25.840
another wire

403
00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.039
that's j2

404
00:26:42.159 --> 00:26:45.679
what's q2 i mean k2

405
00:26:45.679 --> 00:26:53.840
q1 not an x naught it's an or gate

406
00:26:54.559 --> 00:26:59.360
q1 not an x naught this is x

407
00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.840
q1 not that's this guy right here

408
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:07.840
so i gotta run another wire

409
00:27:09.039 --> 00:27:11.840
all the way around

410
00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:20.559
bring it down this way

411
00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:35.840
and feed it all the way down

412
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.559
and the other one i'm going to take one

413
00:27:38.559 --> 00:27:40.240
from x here

414
00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:49.840
put a knot on it

415
00:27:50.559 --> 00:27:53.760
and feed it to this one

416
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.840
and in the lab just if it's working you

417
00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:02.399
take q1 to one of the leds here you take

418
00:28:02.399 --> 00:28:04.559
q2 to the other led and you watch them

419
00:28:04.559 --> 00:28:05.840
to see as you're playing with

420
00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.240
x look at the state where you are see if

421
00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.440
it's doing what it's supposed to do

422
00:28:13.279 --> 00:28:15.039
and you also need to have one for your

423
00:28:15.039 --> 00:28:16.399
output x

424
00:28:16.399 --> 00:28:18.799
and your output x happens to be q one

425
00:28:18.799 --> 00:28:19.600
naught plus

426
00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.880
x naught which is this gate

427
00:28:23.919 --> 00:28:26.320
so this is my x my output if it's candy

428
00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.840
whatever is soda

429
00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:31.840
cigarettes whatever the case is

430
00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:38.240
that's z your output

431
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.440
same gate

432
00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.279
and this circuit will do actually what

433
00:28:47.279 --> 00:28:50.399
that diagram that you saw there

434
00:28:50.399 --> 00:28:52.480
so your output is controlled by only

435
00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.000
this switch that you have here you're

436
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.200
just playing with it

437
00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.679
and whatever the current state is

438
00:28:59.679 --> 00:29:01.600
now before you start anything maybe you

439
00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.279
want to make these guys zero maybe you

440
00:29:03.279 --> 00:29:04.399
want to clear them

441
00:29:04.399 --> 00:29:07.120
you tap the clear key first make it zero

442
00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.480
then you move it back to one it makes

443
00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.600
this one zero

444
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.200
you hit a zero move it back to when it

445
00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.799
makes that one zero you can start with

446
00:29:12.799 --> 00:29:13.600
that

447
00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.960
then you start playing with it and see

448
00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:27.679
what will happen
