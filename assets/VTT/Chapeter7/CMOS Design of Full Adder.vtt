00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.180
hello friends today we are going to

2
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.450
discuss on designing of CMOS full adder

3
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.990
circuit so in previous tutorials we have

4
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.269
found that how to design a CMOS half

5
00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.880
adder circuit now in this tutorial we

6
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.980
are going to see that how to design a

7
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.380
full adder circuit to before designing

8
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.519
this let me draw the block diagram of it

9
00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.839
so as we know the full adder circuit

10
00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.839
always complete comprises of two half

11
00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:33.530
adder circuit so if we quickly draw the

12
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.410
two half adder circuit so this is the

13
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.370
block diagram of it

14
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.970
well a and B of the half adder circuit

15
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.430
of first one will be the input whose

16
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.060
output is nothing but sum that is s1 and

17
00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.910
carry that is it can be taken as c1 now

18
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.209
what happens is this particular sum will

19
00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:06.650
be go through the second half adder

20
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.570
circuit directly that is nothing but the

21
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.810
main sum and for the second half adder

22
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.960
circuit always remember that the

23
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.780
previous carry is always there taken as

24
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.330
the second input of that particular

25
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.780
second half adder circuit like see in

26
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.380
here what happens is this see in is the

27
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.940
input of this particular half adder

28
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.510
circuit is a second block and this is

29
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.280
the two inputs of the second block of

30
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.979
half adder circuit from when once again

31
00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.950
sum and carry is coming out similarly

32
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.590
here also sum and carry is coming out so

33
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.870
this is nothing but C 2 now this C 2 and

34
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.740
the previous scary is going to be simply

35
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.300
added to give you the main output that

36
00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.640
is C out so generally we go through this

37
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.850
particular block diagram and we will

38
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.500
design this thing using VLSI design so

39
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.600
to do so we need to go for step one so

40
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.480
quickly go for the step 1 process so

41
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.989
step one is we have to go for the truth

42
00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.970
table of full adder circuit that is a

43
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.540
truth table of full adder circuit what

44
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.989
is that

45
00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:37.630
a B and C in this is a three input and

46
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.650
main output is sum and carry that is C

47
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.230
out so for three input how many

48
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.010
combination total eight combination so 0

49
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:55.660
0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1

50
00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.590
and one one one so quickly see this

51
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.750
someone someone and for here it is some

52
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.300
zero theorem on similarly here it is

53
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.880
so someone similarly but for these three

54
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.830
cases as all these three are one

55
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.410
so someone carry one so from this

56
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.830
particular thing we are going to see the

57
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.269
sum expression of some so how many where

58
00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:33.769
are the ones out there we have to see

59
00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.610
see here the one is there so it is a bar

60
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:48.069
b Bar C in similarly e bar b c in bar

61
00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:55.220
similarly e b bar same bar plus this one

62
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.090
a B C in so this is the expression of

63
00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.970
some now we will see the expression of C

64
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.810
out see when at the one side there three

65
00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:06.380
occasions

66
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:15.970
so first is BC in plus AC in plus a B

67
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.039
plus a B and C so from there we have to

68
00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:24.940
go through the quickly we will see the

69
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.010
common we have to take the common so

70
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.380
here we can take the common of C in so

71
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.550
we can take a plus B from this 2 and

72
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.770
from here we can take a B common so 1

73
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.539
plus seen so finally what we will get C

74
00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:49.910
in a plus B plus a B into 1 because this

75
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.580
is ultimately is giving you 1 there is a

76
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.310
boolean expression so this expression we

77
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.979
will get so first we will design C out

78
00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:58.460
first

79
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.310
and then we have to see the second step

80
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.050
of full adder because here the pretty

81
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.990
complex cases that particular C out will

82
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.330
be taken as a third input of the next

83
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.840
half a

84
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.510
circuit so if you quickly draw the this

85
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.590
particular diagram so here we'll see see

86
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:21.560
in into a plus B so it should be I am

87
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.800
drawing the pulldown network first so C

88
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.340
in into a plus B so a plus B will be in

89
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:41.600
parallel class means parallel a into B

90
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.270
for pulldown it should be in serious

91
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:51.380
condition so a and B over now the same

92
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.050
opposite will be for pull-up network so

93
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.729
a B in series so a B should be in

94
00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:07.419
parallel this a B is for this a B and

95
00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.060
this whole thing is now parallel so this

96
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.190
parallel will be in series so this is

97
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.890
the series now seen it is in series with

98
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.530
a B barrel so a B will be in series

99
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:31.070
first ABC series first then it is now it

100
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.539
should be parallel with C so I am taking

101
00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:40.100
parallel with seen clear now as this is

102
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.710
whole thing is getting parallel with a B

103
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.350
product so now it should be the whole

104
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.900
thing it is getting series with this

105
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.150
thing so it should we connect it in VDD

106
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.650
and now I am making out my C out but

107
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.870
remember as the automatic inversion is

108
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.180
there in CMOS so this particular C out

109
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.450
will be in C out bar now we have to make

110
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.520
sure we have to understand that C out

111
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.729
where it is taking as a third input of

112
00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:09.080
that particular this half adder circuit

113
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.750
now we have to quickly redraw the truth

114
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.770
table of it and if we assume that you

115
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.780
know ABC in with that if you take C out

116
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:21.850
bar

117
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.370
is the fourth input then what will

118
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.870
happen of some because we need to row

119
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:32.590
you know see out we have already got now

120
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.420
the sum it is the main important thing

121
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.150
we have to think about the sum so to get

122
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.570
the sum we have to go for the C out

123
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:42.940
taken as the fourth input so how many

124
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:50.020
combination 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 month and 1

125
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:55.720
0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 and 1 1 1 right and if

126
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.030
you see the C out to automatically if

127
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:02.740
you take the inversion of it so it was 0

128
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:07.210
0 0 1 so it is 1 1 1 0 and 0 1 1 1 means

129
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:11.320
1 0 0 0 so similarly if you copy this

130
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.140
particular sum from this truth table

131
00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.780
nothing else you know redrawing the

132
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:22.180
truth table okay now from that

133
00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.370
particular tooth table we can draw the

134
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.940
final output so what is that we have to

135
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.010
go for this for occasions where the ones

136
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:35.409
are coming in so here C in C out bar

137
00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:46.540
plus second is B C out 1 plus e C out

138
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:53.650
part plus a B C in so if you take common

139
00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:59.890
of C out bar so a plus B plus C in C out

140
00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:05.140
but Plus this one a b c in now this is

141
00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.660
the final output of some you have to

142
00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.730
make sure to draw how to draw the

143
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.890
diagram see the divergent diagram is now

144
00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:17.050
a plus B plus C in into Z out bar so a

145
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:20.760
plus B plus C in will be in parallel

146
00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:40.830
and see out bar will be in series right

147
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:48.250
so this is he out but if I can take here

148
00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:49.779
directly connection this is nothing but

149
00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:54.190
Z out but now this is okay now plus

150
00:09:54.190 --> 00:10:03.550
means parallel ABC bar all should be in

151
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:06.779
series for pull down

152
00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.480
so pulldown is ready now similarly this

153
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.230
thing will be there in pull-up so as ABC

154
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:26.529
in all in series and here we will do

155
00:10:26.529 --> 00:10:28.810
fast this one so similarly if you take

156
00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:32.740
the pull-up network for it see what

157
00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.560
happens here but initially see out but

158
00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.300
what about was there it was series in

159
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.699
this that should be in parallel all

160
00:10:39.699 --> 00:10:42.910
together it should be in parallel that

161
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:48.190
is this series parallel of ABC in so he

162
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:53.829
be seeing this whole bubble should be

163
00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:57.399
there a be seen was in series now a B

164
00:10:57.399 --> 00:11:01.269
and C in all will be in barrel okay now

165
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:04.839
this part is complete here now whole

166
00:11:04.839 --> 00:11:06.730
thing it was parallel in pulldown

167
00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.040
network now whole thing will be there in

168
00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.790
series ABC it was earlier in series for

169
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.680
this particular part now all thing this

170
00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:24.250
will be in parallel of it a B and C so

171
00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:31.290
it will be a B and scene okay

172
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.079
so from there here obviously you need to

173
00:11:35.079 --> 00:11:37.390
take the connection right so C out bar

174
00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:40.240
here and here also so finally it is for

175
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.380
some you know this is some but remember

176
00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:48.610
one thing this is also some bar and this

177
00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:51.250
is also see out bar to take the pure

178
00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:52.990
output of some you need to take an

179
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.899
inverter of it there also and here also

180
00:11:55.899 --> 00:11:58.060
you need to take one inverter obviously

181
00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.649
remember this inverter will not work

182
00:11:59.649 --> 00:12:01.329
because it is a digital inverter you

183
00:12:01.329 --> 00:12:04.120
have to go for always CMOS inverter to

184
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.829
design so this is how we need to design

185
00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:08.170
the sum and carry so this is how you

186
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:12.550
have to go for the CMOS VLSI full adder

187
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.319
circuit this is how you need to draw the

188
00:12:14.319 --> 00:12:17.709
CMOS VLS a full adder circuit hope this

189
00:12:17.709 --> 00:12:20.620
tutorial helped you to design for CMOS

190
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:24.449
full adder circuit thank you
