00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:05.730
hello friends today in this second

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.970
tutorial we are going to see that how to

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.880
design a half adder circuit or a full

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.660
adder circuit using CMOS VLSI design in

5
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.240
previous tutorial I have already gone

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.330
through that to design some basic logic

7
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.039
gates what are the step by step

8
00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.350
procedure circuit here in this

9
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.310
particular case we will see that what

10
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.929
are the steps need to be followed in

11
00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.510
order to design a half adder circuit so

12
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.219
similarly we have to go step by step

13
00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.829
videos if I go with step by step

14
00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.200
contingent of the half adder circuit so

15
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.820
far step well we need to understand the

16
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.829
truth table of this particular gate as

17
00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.770
it is a half adder circuit if you draw a

18
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.410
half adder circuit we must understand

19
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.199
that this particular block must have

20
00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.260
minimum two or more than two inputs data

21
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.440
inputs here it is may be a and B and

22
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.290
similarly the output should be of sum

23
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.170
and carry here if we assume this

24
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.340
particular block then we have to write

25
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.770
down the truth table of a half adder

26
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.299
circuit so what is the half adder

27
00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.729
circuit truth table if you write down

28
00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.180
the inputs first and output here it is

29
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.710
in sum and carry for two variables

30
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.630
how many combination will come for

31
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.240
combinations so I am writing the four

32
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.280
combinations first yes so for zero zero

33
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.270
sum will be 0 carry 0 for 0 1 someone

34
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.939
carry 0 1 0 someone carry 0 & 4 1 1 what

35
00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.340
will happen some will be 0 and carries

36
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.280
one very simple this we have already

37
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.770
gone through in digital electronics what

38
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.430
is new in VLSI design is we have to

39
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.549
check there are certain steps of VLSI

40
00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.979
technology by means of which we will

41
00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.060
design a pull-up Network

42
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.530
and they pull down Network pull up

43
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.130
network consisting of n was sorry

44
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.810
pull up network will be consisting of

45
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.090
PMO's and pull down network will be

46
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.670
consisting of n verses full of network

47
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.950
must be connected with VDD pull down

48
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.190
Network much we connected with ground

49
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.480
there should be single output and as it

50
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.480
is a CMOS is there to automatically what

51
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.640
is happening automatic inversion is

52
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.709
therefore a CMOS so from the truth table

53
00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.739
we must write down the sum first so sum

54
00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.610
will be we have to see where the ones is

55
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.989
coming so in case number 2 where a 0 and

56
00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:03.890
B is 1 sum is 1 so a 1 B plus another 1

57
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.280
is when a is 1 that is a and B is low

58
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.100
that is B bar so this is how we can

59
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.650
obtain some and similarly we can obtain

60
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.430
carry also how only one single case when

61
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.130
one is appearing so please find out

62
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.280
which cases when both the a and B both

63
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.840
are high that means a and B no other

64
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.570
options are there where the we will get

65
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.790
another high so this is the value of sum

66
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.290
and carry from the truth table we have

67
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.700
found so the 6 and second step is we

68
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.340
have to take the compliment of it so if

69
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:51.170
we take the compliment of output that is

70
00:03:51.170 --> 00:04:00.440
some what will happen so why what here

71
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.500
if we apply some it is as Y so Y bar

72
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.590
will be a power B plus a B bar that's

73
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.380
whole bar so now this will be of a bar b

74
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.690
bar plus maybe if we follow the basic

75
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.180
rule and basic postulates of digital

76
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.040
electronics

77
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.350
okay and similarly for Kerry also so let

78
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.520
me first do the some but so here we are

79
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.910
obtaining this expression where a dot B

80
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.770
so end operation so what we can see is

81
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.830
that in end operation the moment we are

82
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.780
discussing we must understand what is

83
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.820
what was there in P most image should be

84
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.140
connected in parallel here so you wrote

85
00:04:53.140 --> 00:05:04.510
it first see I am drawing Toki mas is a

86
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.480
bar and B bar so I don't hear the two

87
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.080
output

88
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.330
sorry input Ava and B bar both are in

89
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.230
parallel C parallel now class operation

90
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.180
class main series connection so plus

91
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.660
here it is and then a and B so a and B

92
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.560
again for P Mo's both should be both

93
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:38.410
should be parallel a be for this Plus

94
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.100
this line is there so this is the pool

95
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.900
of network which is connected to

96
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.590
infinity fine similarly in pulldown

97
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.270
network also you have to design this

98
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.850
pulldown network also what is that it is

99
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.600
consisting of n Mo's so a while B but so

100
00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.170
even if I mean it should be in series so

101
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.590
like this way

102
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.230
he won river and again class is there

103
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:21.480
that means this line then a dot B a dot

104
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.970
B means N 1 should be end operation N 1

105
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.790
should be in series so we are again

106
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:33.000
going with a B but both are in parallel

107
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.740
why because this class is there to

108
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.389
automatically put should be in final why

109
00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:38.820
because in pull-up network it was in

110
00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.220
series the two product here the two

111
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.200
products should be in parallel satisfied

112
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.919
and from here we will get the sum that

113
00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:50.130
is output so this is not you need to

114
00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.030
draw the sum okay some is done then we

115
00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:59.280
will draw the K okay forgetting what we

116
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:09.570
will do is here as it is carry is a dot

117
00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:14.660
B so we must take the inverted output

118
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.030
what is that if we assume X is a scary

119
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:25.700
so a dot B bar okay so if we apply here

120
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.430
the same thing a dot B bar that means it

121
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.500
can be drawn as or it can be written as

122
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.990
a 1 plus B bar so again as it is a bar

123
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:41.610
plus we were that means what will happen

124
00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.919
is in pulldown network it should be

125
00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:48.450
parallel pulldown network I am drawing

126
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.419
first here in this particular case so

127
00:07:51.419 --> 00:07:59.120
here Y bar plus D word

128
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.470
money it should be in parallel sorry if

129
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:17.120
I plus B 1 for pull-up network which was

130
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:25.639
been series pull up that were consisting

131
00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:28.130
of AP masses and then you connect the

132
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:29.810
pull-up network to VDD and pulldown

133
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.299
network to ground and from here you can

134
00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:36.380
obtain the inverted carry so this is how

135
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.729
you need to design the sum and carry for

136
00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:43.700
a half adder circuit so if you can show

137
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:48.140
this thing it is absolutely ok and now

138
00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.959
we need to call through that whether all

139
00:08:50.959 --> 00:08:53.779
the cases are performing correctly or

140
00:08:53.779 --> 00:08:54.200
not

141
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.100
so there are 4 cases are there for 2

142
00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.140
variables there are 4 combination I will

143
00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.920
show you here one single combination

144
00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.410
okay so that's one single combination

145
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:09.079
here we will see that is nothing but say

146
00:09:09.079 --> 00:09:13.520
suppose anyone say surface case to this

147
00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.589
one say suppose for some so as here we

148
00:09:18.589 --> 00:09:22.459
are not putting travelers on a 0 and B 1

149
00:09:22.459 --> 00:09:27.140
so if I put here we will put a 0 right

150
00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:34.520
here a 0 sorry by using this pencil I am

151
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.089
going to show see here a 0 and whatever

152
00:09:38.089 --> 00:09:42.529
is there 0 you do this a path to

153
00:09:42.529 --> 00:09:44.410
automatically this is 1 this is 1

154
00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:49.360
similarly B is 1 right so B is 1 and B

155
00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.410
part is 0 and 0

156
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:54.740
so due to bubble here what will appear

157
00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.800
here 0 value due to bubble here it is 1

158
00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.440
here as it is 0 but due to bubble it is

159
00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.790
1 and here you see it is 0 but here all

160
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:06.760
the things will be appearing same as

161
00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.220
they are no bubble is there so what will

162
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.160
happen

163
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.639
zero mix that particularly much off

164
00:10:14.639 --> 00:10:17.639
so this is off state is gone energy

165
00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:21.420
dissolves and also it is off and zero is

166
00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:30.959
off so by this what we can see that as

167
00:10:30.959 --> 00:10:35.430
it is off and this is also off circuit

168
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:39.329
this is off and this is also off so the

169
00:10:39.329 --> 00:10:42.360
Sun is no way connected to ground no

170
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.829
connection is there between some and

171
00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:48.629
ground but as this is off but this is on

172
00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:52.620
and due to this also this is all so the

173
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.930
some that is the output it may be

174
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:59.790
connected through this way to maybe that

175
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:02.209
is the some may be connected to vdd

176
00:11:02.209 --> 00:11:05.100
through this particular finish and this

177
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.189
particular beam was so what is the value

178
00:11:08.189 --> 00:11:10.649
that is VDD is logic high this will

179
00:11:10.649 --> 00:11:13.680
appear here in some so let me see what

180
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.319
is the value is there one can also it is

181
00:11:16.319 --> 00:11:18.630
appearing one so this is how in all

182
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:23.240
cases you need to make understand that
