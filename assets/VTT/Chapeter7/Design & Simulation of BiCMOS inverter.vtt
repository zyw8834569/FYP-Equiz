00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.560
in this video I'm going to explain about

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.299
design and simulation of bi CMOS

3
00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.059
inverter using Tanner radio version 2019

4
00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.280
point to this is schematic

5
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.780
representation of bi CMOS inverter here

6
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.970
the bi CMOS is not convincing to MOS

7
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.880
transistor on P MOS on the N Mo's

8
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.429
transistor and to NPN transistor used

9
00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.740
the operation is just similar to the

10
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.820
normal inverter so if you are giving

11
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.890
input is zero when you input the a to

12
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.469
zero means we'll be getting output will

13
00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.550
be 1 Q will be 1 sometimes if you are

14
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.200
giving in place one means will be

15
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.969
getting off will be zero

16
00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.059
the operation is simple if at least if I

17
00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.469
in place a zero now the P n Mo's will be

18
00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.199
off condition the P Mo's the situation

19
00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.188
on condition so VD will be passed here

20
00:01:05.188 --> 00:01:08.939
so now we'll get some base by us so now

21
00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.430
the transistor this transistor will be

22
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.890
in the on condition Q 1 will be in the

23
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.200
on condition so now some current the

24
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.840
emitter current will be produce more

25
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.500
able to control will be produce now this

26
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.400
VDD is passed here so we will be getting

27
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.729
output Q less one if you are giving a

28
00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.780
equal to zero same time this n Mo's will

29
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.890
be off condition this transistor will be

30
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.890
in the off condition so when if you are

31
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.680
giving a is equal to 1 this p MOS

32
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.490
transformed in off state now this n Mo's

33
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.189
will be in the on condition so now the

34
00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.229
input signal past here the transistor q2

35
00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.740
will be on so output will be directly

36
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.450
connected to ground so we are getting 0

37
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.699
so this is operation of bi CMOS inverter

38
00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.490
and this is schematic representation

39
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.489
model Dorothy yes I did

40
00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.730
using the Tanner so next can see the

41
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.160
output output of this bi CMOS inverter

42
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.550
we can get like this what we are giving

43
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.640
one will waiting zero zero means one so

44
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.950
this is output the procedure for how to

45
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.190
draw thee by CMOS is not reusing yes

46
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:46.950
edit the flick is edit go to file new

47
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:57.420
new library browse create a fold up my

48
00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.280
[Music]

49
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:09.690
bi CMOS and click OK

50
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:19.870
if I click Add like movie browse go to

51
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.310
the photogenic 250mm selected files then

52
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.760
they can just go to genome devices and

53
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.500
click OK and then right click add

54
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:42.310
library browse go to folder standard

55
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.549
libraries select the file MAAC click ok

56
00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:54.239
then right click add library browse

57
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.019
select the folder spice and whisker plot

58
00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.519
okay

59
00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:09.639
right click add library browse select

60
00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:12.700
select the folder spice undisclosed

61
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.048
sources that click OK click OK go to

62
00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:22.980
sell new we click OK

63
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.470
to draw a design first and take one

64
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:36.150
people's to compete most then take any

65
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:45.360
animals then we need to NPN transistor

66
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.790
here this NPRM does got 10 we have to

67
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.970
take

68
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.440
then press home button foot to the

69
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.100
screen

70
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:21.260
take the BAI up now please connected to

71
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.350
base of the transistor here this

72
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:33.290
connected to vdd the drawing these two

73
00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.910
like this

74
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.339
[Music]

75
00:05:51.300 --> 00:06:02.150
crying this gate these are output

76
00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:22.740
connect the output port here to spice

77
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:29.599
sauce and we pulse

78
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:56.150
the Nereus II take this ground

79
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.870
you need

80
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:41.490
select the spice sauce ready see

81
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:55.000
instance then select spice plot select

82
00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:05.410
or taste print for you pretend out there

83
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:11.590
try to like this then go to simulation

84
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:17.850
setup select transient analysis you 400

85
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.510
then tantrum

86
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:34.890
add the library browse TT

87
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:45.919
and click ok then plus and simulation

88
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:07.750
so this is output often bi CMOS in water

89
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:12.100
if it is one in is one out will be 0 1 0

90
00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:16.230
1 1 0 0 1

91
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:19.710
thank you for watching
