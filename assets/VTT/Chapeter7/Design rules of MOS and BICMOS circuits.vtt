00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:03.280
hi friends welcome back to the veena

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.799
easy channel

3
00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.040
in the previous videos we have discussed

4
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.519
about the fabrication rules

5
00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.120
and nmos and pmos fabrication process

6
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.679
and field effect transistor now we can

7
00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:16.880
start the

8
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.920
design rules of mos and

9
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.439
by cmos circuits

10
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.840
design rules of mos and by cmos circuits

11
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.920
i will tell you about the color coding

12
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.599
these are used for

13
00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.719
to draw stick diagrams

14
00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.040
first one metal it is light blue color

15
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.280
next poly silicon it is red color

16
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.559
next third one p diffusion it is in

17
00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.960
yellow fourth one and diffusion it is in

18
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.399
green

19
00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.680
next contacts

20
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.039
it is black sixth one

21
00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.239
implant it is a law if it is

22
00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.519
p-type it is like this

23
00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.560
if it is n-type

24
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.400
like this next

25
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.600
if it is pmos

26
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.080
under

27
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.240
and these are connected in

28
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.159
parallel

29
00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.840
parallel if it is

30
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.119
or these are connected in

31
00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.560
series and

32
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.680
it is under connected in parallel

33
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.840
or connected in series

34
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.200
next if it is nmos

35
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.720
under it is connected in series it is

36
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.000
opposite to the pmos and

37
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.520
moss is opposite to the

38
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.240
pmos

39
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.080
and it is in series

40
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.040
in the pmos it is in parallel

41
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.360
in the nmos or is parallel

42
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.400
in the pmos r

43
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.760
is in series

44
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.599
next trans transistor symbol

45
00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.080
in stick diagram

46
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.280
npn transistor n

47
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.720
p n and now it is an diffusion

48
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.300
what is this color

49
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.239
[Music]

50
00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.599
and diffusion

51
00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.360
green color right

52
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.519
next

53
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.159
p what is this color p

54
00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.720
diffusion

55
00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.239
hello

56
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.360
next up if the arrow

57
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.120
is outside that is npn transistor

58
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.120
if the arrow is inside

59
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.720
that is pnp transistor

60
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.440
right p and

61
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.959
p p p diffusion

62
00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.560
hello and diffusion green

63
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.680
p diffusion hello these are contacts

64
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.040
it is in black color

65
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.440
black

66
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.640
right

67
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.680
these are the design rules of moss and

68
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.040
by cmos circuits

69
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:15.840
see the color coding

70
00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:25.199
please like these videos

71
00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.520
if you have any doubt you can

72
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.360
chart in the comment section thank you
