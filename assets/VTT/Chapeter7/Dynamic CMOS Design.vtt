00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.190
welcome to the next session on learn

3
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.799
before you saw in the first part of the

4
00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.379
video we understood about the general

5
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.170
structure of dynamic CMOS design and its

6
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.410
basic working principle in this video we

7
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.570
will understand how to implement the

8
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.880
function f equal to a plus B dot C the

9
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.869
whole bar using dynamic CMOS design to

10
00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.610
implement the given function using

11
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.399
dynamic CMOS design first let us

12
00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.320
recollect the general structure of

13
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.469
dynamic CMOS design and then we'll

14
00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.230
proceed for the given logic so initially

15
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.899
we had the pre-charge transistor which

16
00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.500
was denoted by e em suffix P it is going

17
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.760
to be a P MOS transistor and then we had

18
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.170
an evaluation transistor which was

19
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.369
denoted as M suffix key and this would

20
00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.479
be a n MOS transistor and then we will

21
00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.320
have in between this pre-charge and

22
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.700
evaluation phase we will have a PD and

23
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.000
logic and this will be again implemented

24
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.759
using and the other important point is

25
00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.130
in a dynamic logic all the signal values

26
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.670
are going to be stored in a capacitor so

27
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.070
we will have an output capacitance

28
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.350
capacitor which is denoted by C it is a

29
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.990
load capacitor and this dynamic logic

30
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.060
operates in two phases one is pre-charge

31
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.490
phase and evaluation phase so for that

32
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.320
these two phases are going to be

33
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.020
controlled by the clock signal which is

34
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.159
denoted by CL K so these are the

35
00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.399
prerequisite for understanding the

36
00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.189
dynamic CMOS design to implement the PD

37
00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.570
logic for F equal to a plus B dot C the

38
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.709
whole bar for dynamic CMOS design also

39
00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.209
we are going to implement only the

40
00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.599
pulldown logic

41
00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.579
so we are not bothered about the pull-up

42
00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.579
network so if you are going to do the

43
00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.409
pull-up network when Li we love to go

44
00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.359
for applying de Morgan's law and all

45
00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.200
other stuffs so here we will be doing

46
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.900
just the calculation of FL where FN is

47
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.540
up time by recollecting the static CMOS

48
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.239
design principle Aaron will just take a

49
00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.579
complement of the given function so that

50
00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.370
we can get the N Mo's pulldown network

51
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.930
so this expression is going to denote

52
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.379
you the pulldown network now

53
00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.389
implementing this pulldown logic we have

54
00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:53.379
two rules this is plus which is going to

55
00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.560
denote as some will be in terms of

56
00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.719
parallel connection of transistors and

57
00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:01.180
this dot is representing the

58
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.750
multiplication so if it is

59
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.909
multiplication then the transistors will

60
00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.540
be connected in terms of series so now

61
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.969
we will proceed so it is going to be a

62
00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:15.310
all are going to be n Mo's transistors

63
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.919
so it is a B dot C so B dot C is going

64
00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:31.479
to be anyway in series since we have a

65
00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:33.609
plus B dot C we are going to connect it

66
00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.209
in parallel so let us extend this line

67
00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.870
also to connect in parallel and now we

68
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.470
will have a pre-charge transistor under

69
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.659
evaluation transistor so that we love to

70
00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:51.579
set up so here we will have pre charge

71
00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.109
transistor which is denoted in terms of

72
00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:59.769
P Mo's and we have an evaluation

73
00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.599
transistor which is denoted by Y n wash

74
00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.680
so n MOS will be grounded and the p MOS

75
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.459
source will be connected to VDD and the

76
00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.539
output will be taken at this point which

77
00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:20.440
is going to be F equal to a plus B dot C

78
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.029
the whole bar and we love to connect it

79
00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:27.539
to use ik

80
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.740
this'll be your see it because it is a

81
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.200
dynamic CMOS design all the outputs are

82
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.750
going to be stored in this output

83
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.600
capacitance CL now let us check whether

84
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.820
the implemented dynamic CMOS design

85
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.639
works perfectly for F equal to a plus B

86
00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.040
dot C the whole bar with some specific

87
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.860
values for the first case let us

88
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:56.760
consider a equal to zero B equal to zero

89
00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.850
and C equal to zero so if a B and C are

90
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.450
0 and let us also assume that clock is

91
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:13.080
equal to 0 if clock is equal to 0 then P

92
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.780
Mo's transistor will turn on

93
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.540
therefore the pre-charge transistor is

94
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.130
on and since clock is zero my evaluation

95
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.630
transistor will be in off condition as

96
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.320
the Prima's recharge transistor is on it

97
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.810
pulls the output node 2 equals the

98
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.600
output node to VDD and this VDD is

99
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.000
completely stored in this load capacitor

100
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.600
C so therefore now CL will be pre

101
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.650
charged to VDD in this stage the N Mo's

102
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.539
transistor that the evaluation

103
00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:50.490
transistor is completely in off

104
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.830
condition so that the pulldown path is

105
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.500
completely disabled and here also we can

106
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.280
say that a 0 B is 0 and C is 0 so if all

107
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.280
these things are 0 it is going to remain

108
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.410
disabled and for clock zero definitely

109
00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.060
we cannot come here for the evaluation

110
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.820
phase evaluation phase will take turn on

111
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.460
one he when the clock is 1 so therefore

112
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.440
at this stage we cannot substitute and

113
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.960
find out what is the output F equal to

114
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.650
either it is going to be 1 or 0 in the

115
00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.450
pre-charge fish now let's look it well 2

116
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.330
1 so therefore my evaluation transistor

117
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.240
n Mo's will turn on and P MOS which is

118
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.039
the pre-charge transistor will not turn

119
00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:33.660
on for a high input so therefore that

120
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.960
will remind us in off condition so this

121
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.009
is an off condition now let us

122
00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:42.159
find out what are the values for a B and

123
00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:44.699
C all these are going to remain as 0

124
00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:48.039
again all these are three enemas pass

125
00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:49.990
transistors these three n MOS pass

126
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:51.999
transistors will turn on one leaf or up

127
00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:54.699
high input since zero is a low end but

128
00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:56.259
all these three and mass pass

129
00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:58.719
transistors will remain in off condition

130
00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:01.719
so therefore the evaluation path has not

131
00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:04.059
enabled evaluation transistor has not

132
00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:06.369
enabled this calculation so by

133
00:07:06.369 --> 00:07:08.259
calculating this you will not will not

134
00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:10.809
be able to attain any results because

135
00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:12.339
all these transistors are an off

136
00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:16.449
condition therefore my VC L will retain

137
00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:20.349
its already stored pre-charged value to

138
00:07:20.349 --> 00:07:23.949
VDD if we substitute the values for a b

139
00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:27.550
and c also we can see that it is going

140
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.649
to be whole bar so obviously if all

141
00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:31.749
these things are going to be 0 the

142
00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:33.969
complement of 0 will remain us 1 so the

143
00:07:33.969 --> 00:07:37.479
equivalent of 1 is almost the VDD higher

144
00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:40.059
supply voltage now we will cross it for

145
00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:42.969
the second case where in here we are

146
00:07:42.969 --> 00:07:45.580
going to consider different values where

147
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.870
a is going to be 0 B will remind us 1

148
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:55.449
and C will be equal to 0 now again

149
00:07:55.449 --> 00:07:59.800
considering clock equal to 0 what will

150
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:05.289
happen my VC L will be in VDD it will

151
00:08:05.289 --> 00:08:11.499
have a pre charged value at this stage

152
00:08:11.499 --> 00:08:13.899
the evaluation transistor eme will

153
00:08:13.899 --> 00:08:17.860
remain off so there for evaluation and

154
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.689
the substitution of all these values

155
00:08:19.689 --> 00:08:21.999
cannot be done and the output

156
00:08:21.999 --> 00:08:23.979
capacitance will store the pre charge to

157
00:08:23.979 --> 00:08:26.860
value VDD now substituting clock equal

158
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.969
to 1 it will enter into the evaluation

159
00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:33.849
phase so now we can substitute the

160
00:08:33.849 --> 00:08:40.059
inputs equal to 0 here B is 1 and C is 0

161
00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:42.698
we can see here this n must pass

162
00:08:42.698 --> 00:08:45.130
transistor will be in off condition

163
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:47.680
because it is not going to turn on for

164
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.139
low input and here clock is 1 so

165
00:08:50.139 --> 00:08:51.730
therefore this will be this

166
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:54.610
we'll be in on condition this is zero so

167
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.230
therefore this PMO's transistor will be

168
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.769
in off and here this n Mo's transistor

169
00:08:59.769 --> 00:09:02.350
will also have again in off condition

170
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:05.199
this one this is one so therefore this

171
00:09:05.199 --> 00:09:07.810
will be in on condition now look at here

172
00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:11.740
the connection is in parallel this fan

173
00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.769
either Y and B dot C are in parallel so

174
00:09:14.769 --> 00:09:17.980
therefore even if any one path is on we

175
00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:19.570
can say that the output can be

176
00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:22.750
discharged to grow but here we can see

177
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:25.600
that B and C are seriously connected

178
00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.220
since they are seriously connected both

179
00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.529
has to be in on condition but here we

180
00:09:29.529 --> 00:09:32.290
can see that it is one is an on and the

181
00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:34.180
other one is in off condition so

182
00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.370
therefore this series path is also

183
00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.519
disabled this path is also disabled so

184
00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:41.170
even though we have substituted the

185
00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.389
inputs and the club evaluation

186
00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:46.350
transistor is also one we cannot attain

187
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:50.740
CL to zero because only if all these

188
00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.959
paths if this path is aren't only if

189
00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:55.329
this PD and logic is on this

190
00:09:55.329 --> 00:09:57.490
Emme transistor will try to pull down

191
00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:00.760
the output to zero but here this PD and

192
00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.220
logic is completely disabled here so

193
00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:08.459
this PD in path is disabled we cannot

194
00:10:08.459 --> 00:10:11.529
evaluate so the evaluation goes wrong

195
00:10:11.529 --> 00:10:14.620
since they are in off condition and here

196
00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.480
one transistor is an off condition so

197
00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.819
therefore this series path also doesn't

198
00:10:18.819 --> 00:10:20.500
work so the effort is completely

199
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:25.990
disabled then the VC L will try to store

200
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:29.350
the pre-charged previously stored the

201
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.260
value VDD so now we can even substitute

202
00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:36.519
the values for and see the logical

203
00:10:36.519 --> 00:10:44.889
expression output so 0 plus 1 dot 0 so

204
00:10:44.889 --> 00:10:48.040
that is also going to be 1 so f is equal

205
00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:52.959
to 1 which is equal and to VDD higher

206
00:10:52.959 --> 00:10:55.810
value so here also we can say that the

207
00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.240
implementation is completely correct for

208
00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.269
the given logic now let us see one more

209
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:03.670
case inputs with a

210
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.580
and see with different values such that

211
00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.980
the input values are going to create a

212
00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.560
low resistance path between the output

213
00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.010
and the ground value so it has to pull

214
00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:17.710
down the pre-charge the value to ground

215
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:19.870
so such values we are going to take it

216
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.690
for our consideration so here I am going

217
00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:28.180
to consider for case three so one such

218
00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:32.170
combination is a equal to 1 and B equal

219
00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:36.430
to 0 and my C will remind to 1 so this

220
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:37.510
is the case that we are going to

221
00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:40.480
consider now again we will substitute as

222
00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.770
usual clock will be 0 initially and

223
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:47.140
therefore my MP transistor will be in on

224
00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:47.920
condition

225
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.620
Emme will remain evaluation transistor

226
00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.480
will remain an off condition so complete

227
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.510
the PD n path will be disabled the n MOS

228
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.760
transistor at the bottom will ensure

229
00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.280
that no static power is consumed at this

230
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.080
pre-charge 2 period so that is the

231
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.660
biggest advantage the inputs to the gate

232
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.970
can therefore make at least only one

233
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:09.580
transition during evaluation so once the

234
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.250
clock is 0 this evaluation phase will

235
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:15.490
not work so therefore my vc l will be

236
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:18.400
again pre charge to be ready so this

237
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.760
value will have come here okay so this

238
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.310
is nothing but pre charge to value VDD

239
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:28.450
now we will go for the next case where

240
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:31.480
we will consider clock equal to 1 now

241
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.490
the evaluation transistor is an on

242
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.470
condition now let us substitute the

243
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:38.710
values for a B and C so here at this

244
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.290
stage clock is 1 so therefore this PMO's

245
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.470
transistor will be in off clock is 1 in

246
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:48.610
my evaluation transistor goes on yes one

247
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:50.680
so that for this n Mo's will turn on for

248
00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.130
high input B is 0 this will be in rough

249
00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:58.060
condition and C is 1 this will be in on

250
00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.690
condition now here we can see that first

251
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:04.000
let us look into the series connection

252
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.190
this series connection we can see that

253
00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:08.620
this is an off condition this is an on

254
00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.600
condition for series connection both the

255
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.000
transistors has to be in on condition so

256
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.480
here one is off and the other

257
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.850
on so therefore this path doesn't work

258
00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:20.820
but here we can look at this a this

259
00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.100
transistor isn't on so therefore this

260
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:26.310
path is on here we can see that ei and B

261
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.650
dot C are parallel to each other so for

262
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:31.290
parallel connection even if any one path

263
00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:34.350
is enabled so that is enough for us so

264
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.970
here this a path is enabled so therefore

265
00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.710
we can see the connection like this

266
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:44.250
now the pre-charged a value which is VD

267
00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:49.320
D will be pulled down to zero so

268
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.090
therefore the low resistance path is

269
00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:54.720
existing between this out on the ground

270
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.340
so therefore the evaluation transistor

271
00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.370
is trying to bring down the output value

272
00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:02.430
previously stored value to zero so now

273
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:04.560
the output here that will be stored here

274
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.700
will be zero so now F is f should be

275
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.490
zero now let us substitute the values

276
00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.340
for F equal to a plus B dot C the whole

277
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:18.090
bar and check whether we are obtaining F

278
00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:20.940
equal to zero so VC L will be equal to

279
00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:25.500
zero here so it does 1 plus 1 dot 0 is 0

280
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:29.430
so complement of 1 will be 0 therefore

281
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:32.220
we have obtained the correct value so

282
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.530
with this we can conclude that the

283
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:37.140
design we have implemented is correct

284
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.870
for the given logic F equal to a plus B

285
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:42.000
dot C the whole bar so this is how we

286
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.130
can confirm whether we have implemented

287
00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.740
the logic correctly so this applies for

288
00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:49.590
any logic even we can solve and apply

289
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:51.750
for static CMOS design and check whether

290
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:54.600
we have applied or implemented the logic

291
00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.450
correctly now the main objective is to

292
00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:59.100
calculate the number of transistors

293
00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.650
required for implementing the given

294
00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:05.340
logic using dynamic CMOS design so if we

295
00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.630
are calculating the number of

296
00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.000
transistors required then we can see

297
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:16.730
that the total number of transistors

298
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:21.250
require yes for implementing the

299
00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.130
pull-down logic we require three

300
00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:28.750
transistors so therefore three less two

301
00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:32.200
transistors one is for the pre-charge

302
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.230
transistor and the other one is your

303
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:39.310
evaluation transistor so always it is in

304
00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:45.850
general for dynamic CMOS design for

305
00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:48.550
implementing a logic in dynamic CMOS

306
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:50.890
design the number of transistors

307
00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:54.430
required will be yen less to amount of

308
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.040
transistors so here in this case for

309
00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.660
this particular expression we require

310
00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:02.860
five transistors whereas in static CMOS

311
00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:08.470
design we require two in amount of

312
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:13.060
transistors which was six transistors we

313
00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.570
require for implementing F equal to ei

314
00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:20.800
plus B dot C de kolbar so here by using

315
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.260
dynamic CMOS design we have reduced

316
00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.060
actually the number of transistors

317
00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.790
required for implementing the given

318
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:30.550
logic hence to summarize the properties

319
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:34.780
of dynamic CMOS design we know that the

320
00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.000
PD logic is similar to that of the

321
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.780
static CMOS implementation so the n MOS

322
00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.480
pedia network is going to be similar to

323
00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.420
the static CMOS pdn implementation so

324
00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:47.890
there is no change in that

325
00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:51.010
but we change in the p MOS network the

326
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.780
pull-up network is not completely

327
00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.030
implemented instead of that pull-up

328
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:58.030
network we have two extra transistors so

329
00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:00.640
therefore we require n plus two so if

330
00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.280
the given logic is a three input logic

331
00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.380
then we require n amount of transistor

332
00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:08.349
less to log transistors where these two

333
00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:10.619
transistors are required for

334
00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:13.030
implementing the pre-charge phase and

335
00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.730
the evaluation phase of the dynamic CMOS

336
00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:17.920
design so that is the biggest advantage

337
00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:21.849
of dynamic CMOS design only because of

338
00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:24.699
that the inputs to the gate are able to

339
00:17:24.699 --> 00:17:27.760
make only one transition during the

340
00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.800
evaluation phase and therefore the

341
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:30.460
number of

342
00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.190
stress required will be always less when

343
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:35.770
compared to the static CMOS design also

344
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:37.750
we can see that there is no static

345
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:40.300
current path between VDD so here we had

346
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.840
our VDD and then we had our pre-charge

347
00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.110
transistor and then we had the pulldown

348
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:50.800
logic so from here both the drains will

349
00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.900
be connected and output will be taken

350
00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.720
here and the output is stored in CL and

351
00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:59.230
then we had the evaluation transistor

352
00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:02.110
and then there is a graph so here this

353
00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:05.530
is the dynamic CMOS design so here we

354
00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:07.570
don't have any straight connection

355
00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:10.690
between this VDD and ground because both

356
00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:12.700
these pre charge and evaluation

357
00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.320
transistors they are controlled by the

358
00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.730
clock signal if clock is zero this every

359
00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:21.310
Church face will turn off and the output

360
00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:24.820
path will exist between VDD and out and

361
00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:28.360
if clock is equal to 1 the output path

362
00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.490
will exist this face will be cut off and

363
00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:32.200
the output path will exist finely

364
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.710
between output and grow so either you

365
00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:37.810
will have connection between VDD to

366
00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:40.450
output or you will have connection

367
00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:43.390
between ground to output but no straight

368
00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:46.060
connection will happen between VDD and

369
00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.760
ground so therefore we call this as no

370
00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:52.750
static current path existence between

371
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.630
VDD and ground also because of less

372
00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:57.670
number of transistors required the

373
00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.250
switching speeds will be very faster so

374
00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:03.220
this kind of dynamic CMOS design can be

375
00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:06.040
very much helpful in high-speed CMOS

376
00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.890
circuits one major problem in the design

377
00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:11.980
of dynamic circuits is in the direct

378
00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:15.490
cascading of dynamic circuits the

379
00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:20.050
cascading of dynamic gates fails and the

380
00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:23.470
cascaded circuit does not work due to

381
00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:26.650
local glitch issues glitch usually

382
00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:29.110
refers to a sudden malfunction or a

383
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:32.620
Fault in the circuit hence Domino logic

384
00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.230
is the proper solution to the cascading

385
00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:38.020
problem in dynamic CMOS design to

386
00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.570
understand that cascading problem in

387
00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:41.170
dynamo

388
00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:44.320
Seema's design and the need for Domino

389
00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.450
logic will be explained in the next

390
00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:49.630
video session until then stay safe thank

391
00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.760
you all for watching the video through
