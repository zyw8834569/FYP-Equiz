00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:11.360
in this video session number one static

2
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:27.269
CMOS circuit design dynamic CMOS circuit

3
00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.469
design and number three

4
00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:45.539
Euler's rule for physical design so we

5
00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:53.070
will start from static CMOS circuit

6
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.320
design so let's have a problem that is y

7
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.500
is equal to a B plus C D plus E whole

8
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.159
bar for designing the static CMOS

9
00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.880
circuit design here is the equation for

10
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.250
which we are going to apply the static

11
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.659
CMOS design okay so we will start sub

12
00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.180
separately I may each time a new T that

13
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.409
is to rule with the P Mo's or and mass

14
00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.490
Kelly for P Mo's and n Mo's Primus key

15
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.119
case may be multiplied hoga or + and

16
00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:44.540
multiplied and his plus 4 n Mo's

17
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.380
burski case mayhem look parallel singing

18
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.560
and multiply he kiss me we'll go with

19
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.520
series we mostly utility that is

20
00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.450
opposite and it will be dot for parallel

21
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.919
and plus for series okay this thing the

22
00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.410
you can remember is it like for and moss

23
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.370
be 4 plus same as P for parallel and odd

24
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.080
for series and P Mo's will be opposite

25
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.360
to the and moss okay so here it is like

26
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.330
for static CMOS circuit design a and B

27
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.910
are in parallel sorry in multiplication

28
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.990
so we will design like to two things v

29
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:39.730
TD and the second line is that is ground

30
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.739
so so very Hedo lines truck and VDD and

31
00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.930
ground so forth

32
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.270
we will first drop what and Moscow

33
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.620
equation is a B plus C D plus e so here

34
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.360
it is a B that is a into B into B means

35
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.950
for an mas it is in series so we will

36
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:08.510
take a more circuit this a in

37
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.840
multiplication it will go with series so

38
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:22.580
here it is B okay so now a B a B for an

39
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.160
mas it is in series now addition there

40
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.280
is in parallel so C and this whole

41
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.739
section this whole section will be in

42
00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.049
parallel so we will start from here C

43
00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:42.320
that is here it is C and now it is again

44
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.410
multiplication that is C and T plus a

45
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.940
are n series so C and D plus C's are in

46
00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.350
series but D plus E are getting added so

47
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.800
it will three will be in parallel

48
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:05.720
this this and this here it is d and here

49
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.440
it is e now connect all these like this

50
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.920
and take it round so this section is for

51
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:23.060
and Moss okay now we will draw for

52
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.980
promotion you start it from here but we

53
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.680
must a dot B a dot B are in parallel so

54
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:39.470
they will go like this this is a and it

55
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:45.980
is P to P Mo's so now it is getting

56
00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.220
added with C's added means again in

57
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:55.700
parallel so they are multi prime in

58
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.820
parallel not adding sorry for addition

59
00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.510
it is in series so in addition again

60
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.090
like this and now CC is in

61
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.230
multiplication and T plus C so C will be

62
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:16.040
in C will be in parallel for P Mo's like

63
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.460
this C and D plus C that is ready and

64
00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.020
they are getting added so will be taken

65
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.100
in series so it will be like B and it is

66
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.810
e here it is T and here it is with

67
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.290
purple because it is Primos now we will

68
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:39.890
connect like this this circuit is for P

69
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.710
MOS it is the point from here we will

70
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.850
output Y here we have the whole static

71
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.110
CMOS circuit for this given equation now

72
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.169
for we will discuss dynamic for dynamic

73
00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:00.230
section we will clear assume the P Mo's

74
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.160
as X this whole circuit is taken as X

75
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.570
and n MOS the whole circuits taken is Z

76
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:20.740
so dynamic with it go with dynamic CMOS

77
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.530
circuit design so what is the difference

78
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.090
first of all what is the difference

79
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:35.060
between static and dynamic in static we

80
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:40.490
do not have a clock but in dynamic we

81
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:46.760
have a clock signal so we have to do

82
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.270
nothing just like same the problem was y

83
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:55.730
is equal to a B plus C into D plus E and

84
00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:01.250
whole bar so here it is VDD and again at

85
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:07.040
this point we be to Co with ground now

86
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.630
the same we had working with dynamic so

87
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.270
we will have to pay clock signals also

88
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.920
so for Primos we will take a pea most

89
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.820
hill and for n we will take and signal

90
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:28.460
hill this both a short and a clock

91
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.380
signal is given it is five o'clock

92
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.080
signal

93
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.300
okay now the whole that whole section I

94
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:42.500
can static fit drawn here this section

95
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.700
for P must be taken as X so home loan

96
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:52.190
only half 3 is root over X and here it

97
00:07:52.190 --> 00:08:00.860
is said and this is for Y output exams

98
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:05.170
may appear a circuit drawn of Anna marks

99
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.300
so finally we have the dynamic this

100
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:12.940
whole section is dynamic

101
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:22.560
CMOS circuit for this particular problem

102
00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:26.560
now we will go with third section that

103
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:36.089
is EU l euler's rule for physic curl

104
00:08:36.089 --> 00:08:41.770
circuit design sorry physical design now

105
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:47.860
for Euler's drew the first contra with

106
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:51.880
static CMOS circuit now you know helium

107
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.100
calculate and this is the beauty things

108
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.120
we will start with this X at this point

109
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:03.910
okay you point at this point as you can

110
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:08.339
see we will draw a point that is VDD

111
00:09:08.339 --> 00:09:12.520
and look I can engage her node this is

112
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:20.160
node 1 this is node 2 this is node 3 to

113
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:26.260
node is 3 this is 4 this is 5 and this

114
00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.329
node is 6

115
00:09:27.329 --> 00:09:35.640
okay now GMI repeatediy at node 1

116
00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:41.050
we party there is this is for B it is

117
00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:46.649
like B now for C we will go like this

118
00:09:46.649 --> 00:09:51.190
because he is going through this now D

119
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:58.060
and E D and E so tasty and for e it is D

120
00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.700
and it is e this is the node a this is

121
00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:07.770
no sorry 1 2 it is 3 they treated it is

122
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:17.830
for just notice for it is and sorry P

123
00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:23.680
Mo's we will draw another one that is

124
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:31.600
this is the node 3 and it is going

125
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:37.720
through like this a it is a it is B B's

126
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:42.250
like this now here it is C so C it is

127
00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:49.630
like this C and T and E is B here it is

128
00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:54.270
P and here it is e it is T it is

129
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.560
connected like this and this one is

130
00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:12.839
grounded so he diagrams penology hum a

131
00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:16.480
shortest distance is section C means

132
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.390
hello Jason has a start when I do this

133
00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.700
part is to this

134
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.940
sorry part one part this is up to decide

135
00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.660
decide connect this part is code is

136
00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:32.860
kappahd same day like Laguna is point

137
00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:36.360
three start here on Expedia sect and si

138
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:42.520
from a b d e and z and remember it but

139
00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.460
doable repeat energy

140
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:49.440
so I'm gonna start here from a humbug it

141
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:59.520
is a b b c d e and then is AC up see

142
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:05.089
McGehee Fatima is what it is and must be

143
00:12:05.089 --> 00:12:09.510
try can I keep at a spiritual dragon so

144
00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:18.240
I'm gonna get up from a A to B B to B D

145
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:23.430
to E and E to C so as you can see you

146
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:28.380
look DC e Petaling so busy if it area or

147
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:33.240
ski bottom Ecbatana that is e CC Tommy

148
00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.940
he could appear can apply so on Luke is

149
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:39.360
a part Canadian hemlock chilling gear

150
00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.390
I'm luminescent app definitely has to

151
00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:49.560
start again dd p starting at be reading

152
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:57.240
a low BP be say a this is C and C severe

153
00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:03.350
a so I see a key but C and C severe e

154
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:09.000
now only but spent like like HL taking

155
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:19.290
so it is very 3d this point D be a see

156
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:22.380
and here it is e so you can see John

157
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:22.920
Logan

158
00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.610
yeah well apart is faith imply grant to

159
00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.520
go be part repeat me alright so this is

160
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:41.459
the right I love spot okay now in part

161
00:13:41.459 --> 00:13:45.350
skill a Soviet man

162
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:52.620
the problem was Y is equals to B plus C

163
00:13:52.620 --> 00:14:00.330
into D plus B okay so and the path we

164
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:08.070
decided is D be AC and E now the same

165
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.590
thing as we join a static and dynamic

166
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:18.510
that is VD D and here it is ground now

167
00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:22.310
we are drawing the stick diagram very

168
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:30.900
same so here it is for P Mo's and it is

169
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:37.830
for and moss okay now this is the path

170
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:52.050
so we will go like this it is d be a C

171
00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:59.160
and E now we have to draw the stick

172
00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:04.100
diagram for this section okay

173
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:09.180
let's again take the statics circuit as

174
00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:12.660
you can see here it is source of the p

175
00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:19.920
MOS a drain source drain source drain it

176
00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:24.930
is again source drain source drain now

177
00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:29.310
for n MOS it is drain drain source drain

178
00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:34.790
source source drain drain source and so

179
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:39.570
okay we're trying for a P MOSFET is this

180
00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:44.360
section so we will see the transistor D

181
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:49.640
so for transistor D so we have s and T

182
00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:54.210
so we have to see D and P transistor

183
00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:57.780
that is this this transistor T and B as

184
00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:00.080
you can see the D and s

185
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.110
our same Junction so we will take the

186
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:06.529
train I can see drain of the be that is

187
00:16:06.529 --> 00:16:08.630
train of the B is connected with the

188
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.720
souls of the T so here it is now it is

189
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.330
the train and it is the source this is a

190
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:19.130
and B a and B the source sources of the

191
00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:22.190
a and B are on same side so it is source

192
00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.520
and it is train now a and C as you can

193
00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:30.140
say a and C train of a and source of T

194
00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.160
see sorry

195
00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:37.279
so drain of a source of C okay now C and

196
00:16:37.279 --> 00:16:42.290
E C drain of C and source of the sorry

197
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:47.330
train of e so train of C and drain of ER

198
00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:51.680
in on seems it is source here it is now

199
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.550
we will do the short circuits further

200
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:59.920
for these junctions it is as you can see

201
00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:05.000
here it is the a and B are short a and B

202
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.329
sorry for a source this point is

203
00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:10.550
connected with VDD as you can see the

204
00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:14.300
source of a and source of B not given

205
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.819
with which it is so source of a and

206
00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:21.589
source of B are given with VDD now a and

207
00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:25.280
B the Train of a and drain of B are

208
00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:32.330
short so drain of a and drain Jordan of

209
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:38.210
P and drain of a are short now again you

210
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:44.480
can see the source of D the source of D

211
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:49.340
and source of C source of this source of

212
00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:54.110
C source of D and so soft C are also

213
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:57.290
short circuit so this Junction is

214
00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:00.980
completed here after that we will move

215
00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:05.420
to this junction D and E we will see D

216
00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:10.550
and E here it is d it is e so the drain

217
00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:13.670
of Dean there is this point drain of D

218
00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:17.770
and source of e there is source of e

219
00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:19.760
these are again

220
00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:24.590
well shorted now again this point C and

221
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:29.330
E C and E drain these are already

222
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:35.180
shorted okay now we will take the output

223
00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:39.800
this is from this point drain of C and

224
00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.780
drain of e that is strain of citrine of

225
00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:45.020
e this section we will do it like this

226
00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:49.600
and here it is y now we will draw for

227
00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:56.500
work further and moss so I move and Moss

228
00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:00.770
we are seeing this circuit now similarly

229
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:03.320
this is the drain this is a drain of a

230
00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:08.510
and C will go with a and C the train and

231
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:11.720
drain of a and C are common so a the

232
00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:16.100
drain the drain of a and C okay so here

233
00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.220
it is so series source now we will move

234
00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:25.100
with this train of source of a will go

235
00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:32.870
with this side so D and E B and E now so

236
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:35.720
we will work with DB these two are

237
00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:41.480
together so d the source of D is

238
00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:48.320
connected with source of e B and D P and

239
00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.840
D so yes source of B is connected with

240
00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.470
source of be the source of this

241
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:56.570
connected resource of B so here it is

242
00:19:56.570 --> 00:20:01.610
train in strain now C and E C and E the

243
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:04.040
source of C is connected with train of a

244
00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.030
source of C is connected with drain of e

245
00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:13.760
so here it is T and here it is s now

246
00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:17.000
again the short circuits first of all we

247
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.220
will take the output there is a train of

248
00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.340
a and drain of see a train of a and

249
00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.350
train of see here

250
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:28.179
taken as the output is taken from this

251
00:20:28.179 --> 00:20:31.780
point okay now again from ground to

252
00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:35.200
ground there is D and E the sources of D

253
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:41.710
and E the source of T source of B D and

254
00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:45.880
E source of D P - to ground source of

255
00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:50.110
this here it is also ground okay now

256
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:57.100
this point B and a a and B are short C

257
00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:01.870
and D C and T these I have to win these

258
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.809
are apart so these are also have to be

259
00:21:04.809 --> 00:21:10.000
shorted so the drain of C that is drain

260
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.110
of see this section and train of a that

261
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:18.669
is drain off here it is don't know if if

262
00:21:18.669 --> 00:21:22.840
these are also short okay so I see a CR

263
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.669
together C and D are far C and D so

264
00:21:26.669 --> 00:21:33.570
drain source of C and drain off the

265
00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:41.080
drain of D yeah you can see it is also

266
00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.659
connected D is connected with E the

267
00:21:43.659 --> 00:21:47.760
drain of C D and this is also shorter

268
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:55.890
yeah okay so it is the stick diagram

269
00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:04.270
rule root cooperating so add up this

270
00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:08.590
actor EMI pass a complicated equation ax

271
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:14.789
with a b c d e with v transistors okay

272
00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:19.000
so for trying state diagram for this

273
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.669
equation I'm directing now acceptance so

274
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:22.770
kinky

275
00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:25.210
how do direct questions now section you

276
00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:28.090
see Y is equals to a dot B is Cillian

277
00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:30.610
looks T diagram directness extended the

278
00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.860
main except to be realistic diagram

279
00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:36.460
magneto hum normally pin a sector but

280
00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.629
transition start over that is variable

281
00:22:38.629 --> 00:22:40.909
shadow that tend to stick diagram bring

282
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:45.740
Euler's rule car use of 10 you will use

283
00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:54.679
this rule for physical design so that's

284
00:22:54.679 --> 00:22:59.330
four that's all for today thank you very

285
00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:01.690
much
