00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:37.320
advantage of using programmable logic

4
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.059
device phoenician of programmable logic

5
00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.559
device is the LD shot for programmable

6
00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.549
logic device a generic term for an

7
00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:56.699
integrated script that can be programmed

8
00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.780
in a laboratory to perform complex

9
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.890
functions the PLT consists of arrays of

10
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.720
N or gets a system designer implements a

11
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.920
logic design with a device programming

12
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.009
death blows fuse on the PLD to control

13
00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.890
gate operation a PLD has an undefined

14
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.750
function at the time of manufacture

15
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.329
before the PLD can be used in a sector

16
00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.259
it must be programmed that is

17
00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.179
reconfigure the LD p-- types can

18
00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.920
classified into the following groups

19
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.140
number one is P R or MS is programmable

20
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.749
read-only memory of these these prompts

21
00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:59.100
can offer high speed and low cost for

22
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:10.470
relatively small number two is PLA s is

23
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.069
programmable logic array this can offer

24
00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.040
flexible features for more complex

25
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.610
design

26
00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.719
number three is PA l OG ALS is

27
00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.930
programmable array logic or generic

28
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.370
array logic is awful good flexibility

29
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.230
and a faster and less expensive than PLA

30
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:47.010
is the advantages of using PL d compared

31
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.959
to standard IC and custom IC is cost of

32
00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.319
production because to produce the must

33
00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.010
use in the process photolithography and

34
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.989
the cost of the designs PLD producing

35
00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.220
design which chip do not need any mass

36
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:18.060
as ICS which is one or two months need

37
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.599
to continue cells available on silicon

38
00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:27.000
surface and why design designers have to

39
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.319
be continued between sell cheap labor

40
00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:37.319
costs lbm need design all must must

41
00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.120
generate and processing costs are high

42
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.729
to is first design time the general

43
00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:51.209
characteristic of obld the circuits in a

44
00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.479
fix logic device a permanent they

45
00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:58.129
perform one function or set of functions

46
00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.400
once manufacture they cannot be changed

47
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.310
next the design can be quickly

48
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.870
programmed into a device and immediately

49
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:16.228
test in a life next no need for a common

50
00:04:16.228 --> 00:04:20.820
masked layer is design and very quickly

51
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.280
in the design then is a lag block of

52
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.700
internal connections that can be in the

53
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.790
program and the code

54
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.290
and with a I use a device that consists

55
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.190
of micrometric cells and the last one is

56
00:04:43.190 --> 00:05:24.790
PLD is the input and I'll get a chirp

Errol estimating Desna today I will

71
00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:26.900
explain about the methods of returning

72
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.500
the PMD which is the method of the midi

73
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.650
and language offer the moon methods of

74
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:41.419
programming the PLB there are three

75
00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:44.650
methods of programming the PLD a

76
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.719
brilliant expression technique most of

77
00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:50.120
the logic can be described using n and

78
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.990
yet or on ket P Algy will convert the

79
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.900
product of the number of operation and

80
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.840
carry out optimization for device or a

81
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.689
chip program then transfer the real

82
00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:06.050
logic five attend into the programmable

83
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:11.990
device simple expression of anger is ma

84
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:17.979
reply be an object is a plus B secondly

85
00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:22.069
truth table technique input and output

86
00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:24.800
relation of PLD can be obtained by

87
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.319
reading the truth table and generate an

88
00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:31.719
equivalent project configuration

89
00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:34.849
schematic editor technique draw the

90
00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:37.819
schematic design of a logic device PLD

91
00:07:37.819 --> 00:07:50.330
April types of design language there are

92
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.500
two types of design language firstly

93
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.810
high-level language

94
00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.980
see you PL you can use for

95
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:05.210
low-complexity device HDL and VHDL a

96
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.030
popular higher level description

97
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.960
language for more complex device and PL

98
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.590
the language can be programmer in a

99
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.850
laboratory to perform complex function

100
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:22.820
can leave low-level language a simple

101
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:26.720
language chair is a very strong

102
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.360
correspondence between the program

103
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:34.810

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.040
voltage is applied between the source

118
00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.830
and the drain some church will be

119
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:39.290
induced in a second gate causing the

120
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.089
transistor has a channel that is

121
00:09:41.089 --> 00:09:44.410
conductive for the discharge condition

130
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.230
caused a high electric field

131

to be developed in the channel region of

132
00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.660
this transistor this in turn caused

139
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.070
because the floating gate is run by

metal that forms a low resistance back

190
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.670
between the logic circuit which is

191
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:36.300
tungsten detaining a titanium and silica

192
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.410
the m2m device may need any program to

193
00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:41.250
interconnect

194
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.480
logic circuit in this body because

195
00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.589
interviews it consists of metal one

196
00:13:48.589 --> 00:13:53.600
dielectric oxide and method

197
00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.639
that's all from us thank you for

198
00:13:57.639 --> 00:13:59.999
watching

199
00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.599
