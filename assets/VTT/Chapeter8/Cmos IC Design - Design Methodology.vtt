00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.410
good morning I am Amir Onodera and my

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.790
fellow work met freedom and we will

3
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.610
repress anything about CMOS integrated

4
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.890
circuit design

5
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.970
first question 1 draw a static CMOS

6
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.730
logic circuit and static diagram for the

7
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.839
following logic function first we do the

8
00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.449
pull-up network equation and pull down

9
00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.409
Network equation in pool if it plus it

10
00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:35.400
become x and vice versa in PD n we have

11
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.420
to invert the equation if it x it will

12
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.660
be serious occurred whereas if it in

13
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.690
addition it will be parallel circuit

14
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.810
this is a static diagram for the

15
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.060
following logic function now you will be

16
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.950
seeing about question 2 by using the

17
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.500
question is by using pull-up network PU

18
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.420
and and pulldown network PD and

19
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.300
construct static CMOS circuit based on

20
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.489
the boolean equation we are having two

21
00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.140
equation that is z1 a bar b bar plus a B

22
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.909
bar and z2 FB plus AC the first for the

23
00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.619
first equation will be seeing about that

24
00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.549
one a a B ma and a be first in the polar

25
00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.609
equation will be we will be dividing the

26
00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:32.579
we will be separating the multiplication

27
00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.960
to addition and addition to the

28
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.880
multiplication as we seen over here and

29
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.270
the PD n is test about it's just

30
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.840
inverting about the equation and we

31
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.569
could see this will be the equation of

32
00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:47.549
product of the it will be the result of

33
00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.950
the equation and same goes to z/2

34
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.630
the equation will be like

35
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.090
and this will be the static CMOS diagram

36
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.030
which will be there and when there is an

37
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.670
addition it will be a parallel and when

38
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.660
the when there is a series it will be

39
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.070
when it is a multiplication it will be

40
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.320
serious as to be seen here the Pima

41
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.630
circuit have a bar and B bar because of

42
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.390
the equation same goes the PD and E bar

43
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.300
and B bar this will be the normal

44
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.940
circuit diagram and that's all from us

45
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.540
thank you
