WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.270
so we are going to start with the second

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.990
chapter of module three and that name of

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.189
the chapter this subsystem design

4
00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.000
processes so in this chapter what we are

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.710
going to learn from this chapter is that

6
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.590
what our designer wants so this chapter

7
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.289
is basically the start of the designing

8
00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.369
processes in Walled how and what is the

9
00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.430
thought process to our designer okay we

10
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.439
are after getting the specifications in

11
00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.529
the of the design that is system okay so

12
00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.829
you need to understand that from now on

13
00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.829
whatever it may be the design it will be

14
00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.219
termed as a system it will be termed as

15
00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.510
a system so before we even start

16
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.120
designing we need to think like

17
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.059
designers okay so there are certain

18
00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.430
criterias that the designers followed

19
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.620
before even the start of the design so

20
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.320
before even touching their tools alright

21
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.230
or connecting their MOSFETs they first

22
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.489
of all think what has to be done if this

23
00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.890
is the specification let's suppose the

24
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.900
client has given the specification of

25
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.030
this black box one so before even and

26
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.890
some specifications that client will be

27
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.530
mentioning that I need these specs okay

28
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.500
so before even blindly following that

29
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.390
specification and making this black box

30
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.540
one the designer has to think okay how

31
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.720
come this black box one or this design

32
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.720
that is the system so any design as I

33
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.340
have already said any design that will

34
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.560
be given whether it's a full adder or a

35
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.770
processor or complete design is going to

36
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.970
be termed as a system is going to be

37
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.049
termed as a system so before even after

38
00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.939
getting these two things that okay the

39
00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.710
name of the design and the

40
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.600
specifications now in processors also

41
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.200
you need to be mentioning what kind of a

42
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.509
processor you want depending on the

43
00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.310
criteria whether you are going to make

44
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.129
it into a laptop or a mobile or a

45
00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.260
smartphone whatever it is you

46
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.689
need to mention it according accordingly

47
00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.540
or they will be giving you the design

48
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.680
all right

49
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.010
so though that will be the required

50
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.209
specifications are designed without any

51
00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.849
specification is not going to happen so

52
00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.440
even after getting the specification a

53
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.750
designer cannot simply blindly go into

54
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.420
this okay so first of all we are going

55
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.739
to learn about some general

56
00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.970
considerations okay so after we have

57
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.519
covered general considerations then we

58
00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.440
will be moving forward with the design

59
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.579
of a arithmetic processor okay then in

60
00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.950
the processor what is the next way of a

61
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.829
big thing that is the ALU and in Lu what

62
00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.420
is going to be the next design like that

63
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.230
okay

64
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.680
so basically in this chapter we are

65
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.620
going step by step so first of all we

66
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.480
will be dealing with some general

67
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.799
considerations then we will look into

68
00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.230
the design of 4-bit microprocessor then

69
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.299
from there we will be looking inside a

70
00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.139
4-bit ALU then from there we will be

71
00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:31.620
looking into a 4-bit shifter so after

72
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.169
understanding some concepts of how to

73
00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.599
start a design we will look inside the

74
00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.569
process another processor is our system

75
00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.470
okay this is my final design in order to

76
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.209
make this processor you need to have

77
00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.949
many other components as I have already

78
00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:52.470
discussed this point several times

79
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.060
on the board the flow chart that I have

80
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.909
discussed every time that if the design

81
00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:58.829
given is a processor I need to know what

82
00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.849
are the components inside of that if the

83
00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.919
component names I know then inside that

84
00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.199
component water the sub components are

85
00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:10.650
there so inside the cell you again there

86
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:17.180
will be one shifter so this is my system

87
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.560
this is my system this is my final

88
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.130
design in order to get this final design

89
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.020
I have to go buy this so basically this

90
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.570
is the sub component of the component of

91
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.430
my system and this becomes my sub system

92
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.070
so finally in this chapter what are we

93
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.660
directly designing we are designing a

94
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.540
4-bit shifter if this is the case that

95
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.180
is why the name of the chapter is given

96
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.470
as subsystem design processes at not

97
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.560
simply system getting the point all

98
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.010
right so let us start with the general

99
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.320
considerations now before we even look

100
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.440
into the general considerations for a

101
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.980
designer we need to know three basic

102
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.650
terms related to design we need to know

103
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.180
three basic terms related to design okay

104
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.010
the three related terms are the

105
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.320
regularity okay so we'll start with

106
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.170
regularity so what is this concept this

107
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.810
reckoned irregularity concepts concept

108
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.130
dictates that the design has to be that

109
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:42.330
the design has to be hierarchical

110
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.850
okay it has to be hierarchical what do

111
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:50.840
you understand by the hierarchy

112
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.620
hierarchy that is if this is my black

113
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.160
box one okay if this is my black box one

114
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:04.940
it is made up of x and y so in order to

115
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.730
complete the black box one first I will

116
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:14.540
design X second I will design Y third I

117
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:23.570
will interconnect x and y to get black

118
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:30.800
box one so this is my hierarchy okay so

119
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.220
it has to be hierarchical that means a

120
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:52.270
larger system can be broken down into

121
00:06:53.290 --> 00:07:04.730
simple and similar blocks okay simple

122
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.080
and similar blocks larger system can be

123
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.810
broken down into simple and similar

124
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.000
block blocks when I am writing broken

125
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.720
that doesn't mean you will break it open

126
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.960
here the term broken means it can be the

127
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.570
larger system should comprise or

128
00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:30.290
composed of simple and similar blocks

129
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.560
same compose or comprise therefore I

130
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.450
have written broken broken doesn't mean

131
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.340
you will break it open okay it doesn't

132
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.090
work like that

133
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.600
so in regular here what example that are

134
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.360
given that there are two separate blocks

135
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.490
two separate blocks okay x and y now

136
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:51.380
while I'm designing X obviously X will

137
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.990
be made up of certain other components

138
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.110
inside of X

139
00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:01.970
right so
